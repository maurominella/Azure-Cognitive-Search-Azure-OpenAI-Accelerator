    "- **Notebook 01**: We loaded the Azure Search Engine with enriched PDFs in index: \"cogsrch-index-files\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We loaded a vector-based index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used another ReAct Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",
    "\n",

    "We are missing one more thing: **How do we glue all these features together into a very smart GPT Smart Search Engine Chat Bot?**\n",

    "We want a virtual assistant for our company that can get the question, think what tool to use, then get the answer. The goal is that, regardless of the source of the information (Search Engine, Bing Search, SQL Database, CSV File, JSON File, APIs, etc), the Assistant can answer the question correctly using the right tool.\n",

    "In this Notebook we are going to create that \"brain\" Agent (also called Master Agent), that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) understands the question, interacts with the user \n",
    "2) talks to other specialized Agents that are connected to diferent sources\n",

A Markov chain is a model that undergoes transitions from one state to another within a finite state space. It is characterized by the property that the probability of transitioning to any particular state depends solely on the current state and time elapsed, regardless of how the system arrived at its current state. Additionally, the states of the Markov chain are communicating, which means that a transition between every pair of states occurs within a finite duration. Each state is recurrent, and thus the probability of returning to the same state is one. These properties make the Markov chain a useful tool in various fields, including physics, chemistry, economics, and information technology, among others.
