    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We loaded a vector-based index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used another ReAct Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

These tools themselves can be other agents, each possessing their own set of tools. This creates a layered structure where tools can range from code sequences to human actions, forming interconnected chains. Ultimately, you're constructing a network of agents and their respective tools, all collaboratively working towards solving a specific task (This is what ChatGPT is).
