    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We loaded a vector-based index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used another ReAct Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

      "Markov chains are mathematical models that describe a sequence of possible events, where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.

      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Markov chains work:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **States**: A Markov chain has a finite or countable number of states. These states represent the possible outcomes or positions in a system.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initial State**: The process starts in one of the states, which can be determined by an initial probability distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transitions**: The chain moves from one state to another. The probability of moving from a current state to another state is given by the transition probability. These probabilities are typically represented in a matrix called the transition matrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Memorylessness**: The next state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Transition Matrix**: The transition probabilities are often organized into a matrix, where each entry \\( P_{ij} \\) represents the probability of moving from state \\( i \\) to state \\( j \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Stochastic Matrix**: The transition matrix is stochastic, meaning that each row sums up to 1, representing the total probability of transitioning from a given state to any other state.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Ergodicity**: A Markov chain is ergodic if it is possible to get to any state from any state in a finite number of steps, and the state probabilities converge to a steady-state distribution over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Stationary Distribution**: If it exists, the stationary distribution is a vector of probabilities that remains unchanged by the transitions and represents the long-term proportion of time the chain spends in each state.\n",
