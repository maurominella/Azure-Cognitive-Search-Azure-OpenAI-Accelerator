The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",

    "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes.

    "As observed in Notebooks 1 and 2, each text-based index contains a field named `vectorized` that we have not utilized yet. We will now harness this field. The objective is to avoid vectorizing all documents at the time of ingestion (Option 3). Instead, we can vectorize the chunks as users search for or discover documents. This approach ensures that we allocate funds and resources only when the documents are actually required. Typically, in an organization with a vast repository of documents in a data lake, only 20% of the documents are frequently accessed, while the rest remain untouched. This phenomenon mirrors the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) found in nature."

In\\ngeneral, decidability depends on the constraint domain C. On the one hand, Devienne\\net al. (1993) have established undecidability of termination for one-rule binary CLP(H)\\nprograms, where H is the domain of Herbrand terms. On the other hand, Datalog, i.e.,\\nlogic programming with no function symbols, provides an example of a constraint pro-\\ngramming language such that termination is decidable. We note that the decidability of\\nthe related problem of boundedness for Datalog queries has been studied, for instance,\\nin (Afrati et al. 2005; Marcinkowski 1996). For constraint domains with the undecidable\\ntermination property, we are interested in subclasses of programs such that termination is\\ndecidable for these subclasses. A trivial example is the subclass of non-recursive programs.\\n\\nWe organise the paper as follows. After the preliminary remarks of Section 2, in Sec-\\ntion 3 we present our main result. Section 4 reviews related results before our conclusion.\\n\\nhttp://arXiv.org/abs/cs/0701082v1\\n\\n\\n2 Fred Mesnard and Alexander Serebrenik\\n\\n2 Preliminaries\\n\\nFor CLP-related definitions, we follow (Jaffar et al. 1998). Extensive introductions to CLP\\ncan be found in (Jaffar and Maher 1994; Marriott and Stuckey 1998). The key notions of\\nCLP are those of an algebra and an associated constraint solver over a class of constraints,\\nnamely a set of first order formulas including the always satisfiable constraint true, the un-\\nsatisfiable constraint false, and closed under variable renaming, conjunction and existential\\nquantification. If c is a constraint, we write ∃c for its existential closure. We consider ideal\\nCLP(C), i.e., we require the existence of a constraint solver solvC mapping in finite time\\neach constraint to true or false such that if solvC(c) = false then the constraint ∃c is\\nfalse with respect to C and if solvC(c) = true then the constraint ∃c is true with respect to\\nC. The associated domain is denoted DC. Given a constraint c, a solution of c is a mapping\\nθ from the set of variables to DC such that cθ is true with respect to C. The set of predicate\\nsymbols associated with C is denoted ΠC. We are interested in the following domains and\\nlanguages:\\n\\n• N. The predicate symbols are = and ≥, the function symbols are 0, 1, and +.\\n• Q and R. The predicate and function symbols are as above. Q+ and R+ restrict Q\\n\\nand R to non-negative numbers.\\n\\nGiven a CLP(C)-program P, we define ΠP as the set of user-defined predicate symbols\\nappearing in P. We restrict our attention to flat programs, i.e., finite sets of rules in a flat\\nform. So each rule is of form: either q0(ỹ0)← c or q0(ỹ0)← c,q1(ỹ1), . . . ,qn(ỹn) where c\\nis a constraint, q0, . . . ,qn ∈ ΠP, ỹ0, . . . , ỹn denote tuples of distinct variables,\\n\\nTn\\ni=0 ỹi = ∅,\\n\\nand the set of free variables of the constraint c is included in\\nSn\\n\\ni=0 ỹi. Flat queries are de-\\nfined accordingly. A binary program is a flat program such that all rules have no more\\nthan one user-defined body subgoal. The C-base BC\\n\\nP is defined as {p(d1, . . . ,dn) | p ∈\\nΠP,(d1, . . . ,dn) ∈ (DC)n}. For a flat query Q of the form c,A1, . . . ,An, the set of ground\\ninstances of Q, denoted groundC(Q), is the set of conjunctions of the form A1θ, . . . ,Anθ\\nwhere θ is a solution of c. The notion of groundedness is extended to flat rules and pro-\\ngrams.\\n\\nExample 1\\nConsider the following CLP(Q) program P:\\n\\nr1 p(x) ← x = 2.\\n\\nr2 p(x) ← 0 = 1.\\n\\nr3 p(x) ← 72≥ x,y = x + 1, p(y).\\n\\nThis program is a binary program, groundQ(r1) is {p(2)}, groundQ(r2) is ∅, groundQ(r3)\\n\\nis an infinite set that contains, among others, p(72)← p(73) and p(1/2)← p(3/2), and\\ngroundQ(P) = groundQ(r1)∪ groundQ(r2)∪ groundQ(r3). ',\n",
       "                'Note that ground instances do\\nnot contain any constraint.\\n\\nWe now discuss the operational semantics of CLP-programs we consider in this paper.\\nA state of computation is a pair 〈A1, . . . ,An‖c〉. We further assume that one of the atoms in\\nA1, . . . ,An, say Ai, is selected for resolution by a selection rule. The operational semantics\\ncan be expressed by means of the following rewriting rules:\\n\\n\\n\\nRecurrence with affine level mappings is P-time decidable for CLP(R) 3\\n\\n• 〈A1, . . . ,An‖c〉 rewrites to 〈�‖false〉 if there exists a fresh rule A′i← c′,B1, . . . ,Bm in\\nP such that c∧ (Ai = A′i)∧ c′ is unsatisfiable;\\n• 〈A1, . . . ,An‖c〉 rewrites to 〈A1, . . . ,Ai−1,B1, . . . ,Bm,Ai+1, . . . ,An||c∧Ai = A′i ∧ c′〉 if\\n\\nthere exists a fresh rule A′i← c′,B1, . . . ,Bm in P such that c∧ (Ai = A′i)∧c′ is satisfi-\\nable.\\n\\nA derivation from a state S0 is a finite or infinite sequence of states S0,S1, . . . ,Sn, . . . such\\nthat each Si can be rewritten as Si+1. A ground state is a state 〈A1, . . . ,An‖true〉 where each\\nAi belongs to BC\\n\\nP . We say that a CLP(C) program P is terminating if every derivation start-\\ning from any ground state via any selection rule is finite, under the operational semantics\\ndefined above.\\n\\nTo characterize this notion of termination, we use the notion of level mapping. A level\\nmapping for a constraint domain C is a function | · | : BC\\n\\nP → R. We adapt the idea of recur-\\nrence, originally introduced in (Bezem 1993), to CLP:\\n\\nDefinition 1\\nLet P be a flat CLP(C) program, and | · | : C-base→ R be a level mapping. P is called\\nrecurrent with respect to | · | if there exists a real number ε > 0 such that, for every A←\\nB1, . . . ,Bn ∈ groundC(P), |A| ∈ R+, and |Bi| ∈ R+, |A| ≥ |Bi|+ ε for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. We\\nsay that P is recurrent if there exists a level-mapping such that P is recurrent with respect\\nto it.\\n\\nObserve that rules of the form p(x̃)← c are not taken into account by the definition\\nabove. Moreover, without loss of generality, we may fix ε to 1: if P is recurrent in this\\nnarrow sense, P is trivially recurrent with respect to Definition 1. Conversely, since ε > 0,\\nwe can safely multiply the values of the level mapping by 1/ε.\\n\\nTheorem 1\\n(Bezem 1993) P is recurrent if and only if P is terminating.\\n\\n3 Alm-recurrent programs\\n\\nLet us consider programs that can be analyzed by means of affine level mappings.\\n\\nDefinition 2\\nA level mapping | · | is called affine if for any n-ary predicate symbol p ∈ ΠP, there exist\\nreal numbers µp,i, 0≤ i≤ n, such that for any atom p(e1, . . . ,en) ∈ BC\\n\\nP :\\n\\n|p(e1, . . . ,en)|= µp,0 +\\nn\\n\\n∑\\ni=1\\n\\nµp,iei\\n\\nSo for a given atom p(ẽ), its affine level mapping is a linear combination of ẽ shifted by\\na constant. We can define the class of programs we are interested in:\\n\\nDefinition 3\\nLet P be a flat CLP(C) program. We say that P is alm-recurrent if there exists an affine\\nlevel mapping | · | such that P is recurrent with respect to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Fred Mesnard and Alexander Serebrenik\\n\\nExample 2\\nThe CLP(Q) program P from Example 1 is alm-recurrent with respect to |p(x)|= 73− x.\\n\\nClearly, if P is alm-recurrent, then P is recurrent thus terminating. Let us show that alm-\\nrecurrence can be efficiently decided. We start with proving this result for binary programs.\\n\\nTheorem 2\\nAlm-recurrence of a binary constraint logic program P over Q,Q+,R and R+ is decidable\\nin polynomial time with respect to the size of P.\\n\\nProof\\nThe proof is constructive: we provide a decision procedure for alm-recurrence of binary\\nconstraint logic programs over Q,Q+,R and R+. The decision procedure extends the al-\\ngorithm proposed in (Sohn and Van Gelder 1991) for termination of Prolog programs (ab-\\nstracted as CLP(N) programs) to binary CLP(C) where C is Q,Q+,R or R+. The algo-\\nrithm tries to find an affine level mapping showing that P is alm-recurrent by examining\\neach user-defined predicate symbol p of a binary CLP program P in turn (the precise order\\ndoes not matter). For every rule r, say p(x̃p)← c,q(x̃q), we test the satisfiability of c. For\\nthe domains we consider, it can be done in polynomial time (Khachiyan 1979). If c is not\\nsatisfiable, we disregard this rule. Otherwise, let np and nq be the arities of p and q. For the\\nrule r, recurrence is equivalent to:\\n\\nC |= c→ [|p(x̃p)| ≥ 1 + |q(x̃q)| ∧ |q(x̃q)| ≥ 0] (1)\\n\\nNote that the condition c→ |p(x̃p)| ≥ 0 can be omitted as it is implied by (1). Formula (1)\\nis logically equivalent to C |= c→ |p(x̃p)| ≥ 1+ |q(x̃q)| and C |= c→ |q(x̃q)| ≥ 0. Let x̃p be\\n(xp,1, . . . ,xp,np), x̃q be (xq,1, . . . ,xq,nq) and let µp,0, . . . ,µp,np ,µq,0, . . . ,µq,nq ∈R be such that\\nfor any atom p(e1, . . . ,enp)∈ BC\\n\\nP and any atom q(e1, . . . ,enq)∈BC\\nP : |p(e1, . . . ,enp)|= µp,0 +\\n\\n∑np\\ni=1 µp,iei and |q(e1, . . . ,enq)| = µq,0 + ∑\\n\\nnq\\ni=1 µq,iei. Hence, c should imply (µp,0− µq,0)+\\n\\n∑np\\ni=1 µp,ixp,i + ∑\\n\\nnq\\ni=1(−µq,i)xq,i ≥ 1 and µq,0 + ∑\\n\\nnq\\ni=1 µq,ixq,i ≥ 0. For the sake of uniformity,\\n\\nwe rewrite the second inequality as µq,0 + ∑np\\ni=1 0xp,i + ∑\\n\\nnq\\ni=1 µq,ixq,i ≥ 0. ',\n",
       "                'Both inequalities\\n\\ncan be presented using the scalar product notation as µ̃x̃≥ 1 and µ̃′x̃≥ 0, where:\\n\\nx̃ = (x0,xp,1, . . . ,xp,np ,xq,1, . . . ,xq,nq)\\n\\nx0 is a new variable fixed to 1 and used to obtain the free coefficient in the product\\nµ̃ = (µp,0−µq,0,µp,1, . . . ,µp,np ,−µq,1, . . . ,−µq,nq)\\n\\nµ̃′ = (µq,0,0, . . . ,0,µq,1, . . . ,µq,nq).\\n\\nHence, the binary rule r gives rise to the following two pseudo linear programming\\nproblems. The problems are pseudo linear rather than linear because symbolic parameters\\nappear in the objective functions.\\n\\nminimise θ = µ̃x̃ subject to c∧ x0 = 1 (2)\\n\\nminimise δ = µ̃′x̃ subject to c∧ x0 = 1 (3)\\n\\nWe note that c∧ x0 = 1 is satisfiable as c is satisfiable and x0 is a new variable, and we\\nrewrite c∧x0 = 1 as Ax̃≥ b in the standard way (Schrijver 1986). An affine level mapping\\n| · | ensuring recurrence exists at least for this rule if and only if θ∗ ≥ 1 and δ∗ ≥ 0, where\\nθ∗ and δ∗ denote the minima of the corresponding objective functions. Because of the\\n\\n\\n\\nRecurrence with affine level mappings is P-time decidable for CLP(R) 5\\n\\nsymbolic constants µp,i and µq,i, neither (2) nor (3) is a linear programming problem. Now,\\nthe idea is to consider the dual form:\\n\\nmaximise η = bT ỹ subject to AT ỹ = µ̃T ∧ ỹ≥ 0 (4)\\n\\nmaximise γ = bT z̃ subject to AT z̃ = µ̃′T ∧ z̃≥ 0 (5)\\n\\nwhere ỹ and z̃ are tuples of adequate length of new variables. By the duality theorem of\\nlinear programming which holds in C (see (Schrijver 1986) for instance), we have θ∗ = η∗\\n\\nand δ∗ = γ∗. Furthermore, we observe that µ̃ appears linearly in the dual problem (4).\\nHence the constraints of (4) can be rewritten, by adding η≥ 1 as a set of linear inequations\\ndenoted Sp≥1+q\\n\\nr . Similarly, the constraints of (5) can be rewritten, by adding γ ≥ 0 as a\\nset of linear inequations, denoted Sq≥0\\n\\nr . Let us define defnP(p) as the set of binary rules\\ndefining p in P, Sp as the conjunction\\n\\nV\\n\\nr∈defnP(p)[S\\np≥1+q\\nr ∧Sq≥0\\n\\nr ], and SP as the conjunction\\nV\\n\\np∈ΠP\\nSp. We have by construction SP is satisfiable if and only if there exists a affine level\\n\\nmapping ensuring recurrence of P.\\nMoreover, as P is a finite set of binary rules, computing SP can be done in polynomial\\n\\ntime with respect to the size of P and results in a constraint the size of which is also\\npolynomial with respect to the size of P. Finally, testing satisfiability of SP in Q, Q+, R,\\nand R+ can be done in polynomial time (Khachiyan 1979).\\n\\nExample 3\\nApplying the algorithm to the example 1, we obtain the following two pseudo linear pro-\\ngramming problems corresponding to (2) and (3), respectively:\\n\\nminimise θ = µp,1x1−µp,1x2 subject to 72≥ x1∧ x2 = x1 + 1∧ x0 = 1\\n\\nminimise δ = µp,0 + µp,1x2 subject to 72≥ x1∧ x2 = x1 + 1∧ x0 = 1\\n\\nRewriting the system of constraints as Ax̃ ≥ b and switching to the dual form, we get the\\nsystem SP:\\n\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f3\\n\\nη = y1− y2−72 ∗ y3 + y4− y5,\\n\\nη≥ 1,\\n\\ny1− y2 = 0,−y3− y4 + y5 = µp,1,\\n\\ny4− y5 =−µp,1,\\n\\ny1 ≥ 0,\\n\\ny2 ≥ 0,\\n\\ny3 ≥ 0,\\n\\ny4 ≥ 0,\\n\\ny5 ≥ 0\\n\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8fe\\n\\n∪\\n\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f3\\n\\nγ = z1− z2−72 ∗ z3 + z4− z5,\\n\\nγ≥ 0,\\n\\nz1− z2 = µp,0,\\n\\n−z3− z4 + z5 = 0,\\n\\nz4− z5 = µp,1,\\n\\nz1 ≥ 0,\\n\\nz2 ≥ 0,\\n\\nz3 ≥ 0,\\n\\nz4 ≥ 0,\\n\\nz5 ≥ 0\\n\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\n\\uf8fe\\n\\nSince SP is satisfiable, P is alm-recurrent.

Let P′ be the binary constraint logic program such\\nthat for every rule q0(ỹ0)← c,q1(ỹ1), . . . ,qn(ỹn) with n≥ 1 in P, P′ contains the following\\nrules:\\n\\nq0(ỹ0)← c,q1(ỹ1).\\n\\n. . .\\n\\nq0(ỹ0)← c,qn(ỹn).\\n\\nand nothing else. From Definition 1, we note that P is recurrent if and only if P′ is re-\\ncurrent. Moreover, the size of P′ is polynomial in the size of P. Hence, by Theorems 2,\\nalm-recurrence of P′ is P-time decidable.\\n\\nAlthough the technique above is not complete for programs over N, it is a sound way to\\nprove recurrence of programs over this domain: if a program is recurrent over Q, it is also\\nrecurrent over N. For binary programs, as we allow negative coefficients in the level map-\\nping, we get a more powerful criterion than the one proposed in (Sohn and Van Gelder 1991).\\n',\n",
       "                'For instance, termination of Example 1 (considered as a CLP(N) program) cannot be\\nproved by (Sohn and Van Gelder 1991).\\n\\nFor binary CLP(Q) programs, the decision procedure described above has been pro-\\ntotyped in SICStus Prolog (SICS 2005) using the Simplex algorithm (Dantzig 1951) and\\na Fourier-based projection operator (Holzbaur 1995) to ease manual verification. There-\\nfore, the complexity of the prototype is not polynomial. The implementation is available at\\nhttp://www.univ-reunion.fr/∼gcc/soft/binterm4q.tgz\\n\\n4 Related Works\\n\\nThe basic idea of identifying decidable and undecidable subsets of logic programs goes\\nback to (Devienne et al. 1993).\\n\\nRecently, decidability of classes of imperative programs has been studied in (Cousot 2005;\\nPodelski and Rybalchenko 2004; Tiwari 2004). Tiwari considers real-valued programs with\\nno nested loops and no branching inside a loop (Tiwari 2004). Such programs correspond\\nto one-binary-rule CLP(R). The author provides decidability results for subclasses of these\\nprograms. Our approach does not restrict nesting of loops and it allows internal branching.\\nWhile in general termination of such programs is undecidable (Tiwari 2004), we identified\\na subclass of programs with decidable termination property. Termination of the following\\nCLP(R) program and its imperative equivalent can be shown by our method but not by the\\none proposed in (Tiwari 2004).\\n\\nExample 4\\n\\nq(x) ← −20≤ x,x≤ 20,y + 5 = x,q(y).\\nq(x) ← 0≤ x,x≤ 100,y + 1 = x,q(y).\\n\\nhttp://www.univ-reunion.fr/~gcc/soft/binterm4q.tgz\\n\\n\\nRecurrence with affine level mappings is P-time decidable for CLP(R) 7\\n\\nwhile ((−20≤ x≤ 20) or (0 ≤ x≤ 100)) do\\nif (−20≤ x≤ 20) x = x−5 fi\\nif (0≤ x≤ 100) x = x−1 fi\\n\\nod\\n\\nSimilarly to (Tiwari 2004), Podelski and Rybalchenko (2004) have considered programs\\nwith no nested loops and no branching inside a loop. However, they focused on integer\\nprograms and provide a polynomial time decidability technique for a subclass of such\\nprograms. In case of general programs their technique can be applied to provide a sufficient\\ncondition for liveness.\\n\\nIn a recent paper, Cousot (2005) applied abstraction techniques and langrangian relax-\\nation to prove termination. Extension of the basic technique should be able to analyse\\nloops with disjunctions in their condition such as Example 4. However, complexity of the\\napproach is not discussed and it is not clear whether the technique is complete for some\\nclass of programs.\\n\\nOne might like to investigate a more expressive language of constraints including poly-\\nnomials. Recall that we require the constraints domain to be ideal, i.e., one needs a decision\\nprocedure for existentially closed conjunctions. Such a decision procedure exists, for in-\\nstance, for real-closed fields such as R (Tarski 1931; Renegar 1992). For some domains\\nsuch as Q, existence of a decision procedure is still an open problem, although it seems\\nto be unlikely (Pheidas 2000). If one restricts attention to real-closed fields, one might\\neven consider polynomial level-mappings of a certain power rather than the affine ones.\\nOne can show that in this case proving recurrence is equivalent to determining satisfia-\\nbility of the equivalent quantifier-free formula (Tarski 1931; Tarski 1951). Hence, recur-\\nrence is still decidable in this case. Although the known complexity bound of determining\\nthe equivalent quantifier-free formula given an existential formula is a double exponen-\\ntial (Basu et al. 1996; Collins 1975), to the best of our knowledge the complexity of the\\nsubclass of formulas which we obtain is an open question.\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper we have considered constraints solving over the rationals and the reals. For\\nthese domains we have identified a class of CLP programs such that an affine level map-\\nping is sufficient to prove their recurrence. We have seen that membership to this class\\nis decidable and presented a polynomial-time decision procedure. The decision procedure\\ncan also be used as a sound termination proof technique for binary CLP(N) and has been\\nprototyped in SICStus Prolog for binary CLP(Q).\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank the referees for useful suggestions.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAFRATI, F.

Many logic programming based approaches can be used to\\ndescribe and solve combinatorial search problems. On the one hand there\\nis constraint logic programming which computes a solution as an answer\\nsubstitution to a query containing the variables of the constraint satis-\\nfaction problem. On the other hand there are systems based on stable\\nmodel semantics, abductive systems, and first order logic model gen-\\nerators which compute solutions as models of some theory. This paper\\ncompares these different approaches from the point of view of knowledge\\nrepresentation (how declarative are the programs) and from the point of\\nview of performance (how good are they at solving typical problems).\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nConsistency techniques are widely used for solving finite domain constraint sat-\\nisfaction problems (CSP) [19]. These techniques have been integrated in logic\\nprogramming, resulting in finite domain constraint logic programming (CLP)\\n[20]. In this paradigm, a program typically creates a data structure holding the\\nvariables of the CSP to be solved, sets up the constraints and uses a labelling\\ntechnique to assign values to the variables. The constraint solver uses consistency\\ntechniques to prune the search. This leads to a rather procedural programming\\nstyle. Moreover, the problem description is not very declarative because the map-\\nping between domain variables and their value has an indirect representation in\\na term structure.\\n\\nIn this paper, we compare CLP and three computational paradigms allowing\\nproblem solving based on more declarative representations. A common feature of\\nthese approaches is that the relation between the CSP variables and their values\\nis encoded as a predicate or function relating identifiers of the CSP variables\\nwith their value. E.g. in the graph coloring problem, the predicate relates node\\nnumbers with colors. This representation allows for a more natural declarative\\nrepresentation of the problem.\\n\\nOne approach is specification in first order logic. As pointed out in [12], one\\ncan represent a CSP as a first order logic theory such that (part of) its models\\n\\nhttp://arXiv.org/abs/cs/0011030v1\\n\\n\\ncorrespond to the solutions of the CSP. Hence first order model generators such\\nas SEM [24] can be used to solve such problems.\\n\\nThe two other approaches use extensions of logic programming. Recently, a\\nlogic programming paradigm based on stable model semantics [6] has emerged.\\nNiemelä [14] proposes it as a constraint programming paradigm, Marek and\\nTruszczyński [13] introduce Stable Logic Programming and Lifschitz [11] pro-\\nposes Answer Set Programming. As described in [13], the methodology of these\\napproaches is to encode a computational problem by a logic program such that\\nits stable models represent the solutions. A number of efficient systems for com-\\nputing stable models have been developed. Of these, Niemelä’s smodels [15, 14]\\nis considered one of the most performant systems.\\n\\nAbduction [8] uses a similar predicate representation for the relation between\\nthe identifiers of CSP variables and their value. This predicate is declared to be\\nopen or abducible. Constraining this relation to be a solution, an abductive\\nsystem will return models of the abducible which are solutions of the CSP.\\n\\nWe use some typical CSP problems to compare the merits of the various\\napproaches. One experiment is in graph coloring. We have compared the rep-\\nresentation and the performance of CLP with the three other approaches in a\\nsequence of experiments where the size of the graph increases and the number\\nof colors remains constant. Another experiment is the n-queens problem where\\nboth the domain size and the number of constraints increases with increasing\\nproblem size. We also report on experiments using CLP, stable logic program-\\nming and abduction for solving a complex real world scheduling problem. For\\neach different system, we have tried to use any special features provided by it.\\n\\nIn Section 2 we review in more detail the various approaches and systems,\\nfocusing mainly on the knowledge representation aspects. Section 3 reports on\\nthe experiments and we conclude in Section 4.\\n\\nWe are not aware of any previous work which compares this wide range of\\nlogic based systems for their suitability in solving CSP problems. Mackworth [12]\\nexplores the space of possible CSP formalizations but assesses neither the quality\\nfrom point of view of knowledge representation nor the performance of actual\\nsystems. Also, approaches based on stable model semantics and abduction are\\nnot included in his work. ',\n",
       "                'This paper is an extension and revision of [17] which\\nfocuses more on the formal relations between the declarative specifications of\\nthe problems on the different systems.\\n\\nOne more problem which uses aggregate functions is included in the present\\npaper. So is an additional experiment for finding all solutions of the n-queens\\nproblem. Finally, some comments from the authors of the different systems were\\ntaken into account.\\n\\n2 Formalisms and Systems\\n\\nA constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is usually defined as a finite set of con-\\n\\nstraint variables X = {X1, . . . , Xn} (the variables of the CSP), a finite domain\\nDi of possible values for each variable Xi, and a finite set of constraint relations\\n\\n\\n\\nR where each r ∈ R is a constraint between a subset of the set X of variables. A\\nsolution is an instantiation of the variables of X which satisfies all the constraints\\nin R.\\n\\n2.1 Constraint Logic Programming\\n\\nConstraint logic programming (CLP) [7] is an extension of logic programming\\nwhere some of the predicate and function symbols have a fixed interpretation over\\nsome subdomain (e.g. finite trees or real numbers). Special purpose constraint\\nsolvers are integrated with a logic programming system for efficient reasoning on\\nthese symbols. This results in a very expressive language which can efficiently\\nsolve problems in many domains.\\n\\nVan Hentenryck [20] pioneered the work on finite domain constraint logic\\nprogramming, CLP(FD), by introducing domain declarations for the logic vari-\\nables and integrating consistency techniques as part of the SLD proof procedure.\\nA CLP(FD) system supports standard arithmetic relations (=, 6=, <) and func-\\ntions (+,−, ∗) on the natural numbers. A typical formulation of the n-queens\\nproblem is as follows:\\n\\nqueens(N, L)←\\nlength(L, N),\\ndomain(L, 1, N),\\nconstrain all(L),\\nlabeling(L).\\n\\nconstrain all([]).\\nconstrain all([X |Xs])←\\n\\nconstrain between(X, Xs, 1)\\nconstrain all(Xs).\\n\\nconstrain between(X, [], N).\\nconstrain between(X, [Y |Y s], N)←\\n\\nsafe(X, Y, N),\\nN1 is N + 1,\\nconstrain between(X, Y s, N1).\\n\\nsafe(X1, X2, D)←\\nX1 6= X2, abs(X1 −X2) 6= D.\\n\\nExecuting the query queens(n, L) first creates a list L with n variables where\\nthe ith variable gives the column position of the queen on row i. Then the\\nconstraints expressed with the safe/3 predicate are added by using two nested\\nrecursive predicates. Such procedural code for setting up constraints and the\\nencoding of the solution in a large data structure results in a rather procedural\\nstyle which is typical for the CLP approach.\\n\\n2.2 First Order Logic: Model Generation\\n\\nThe most elegant solution for the n-queens problem is using many sorted first\\norder logic and first order model generation. Systems like FINDER and SEM\\n\\n\\n\\n[24] are examples. One can introduce functions (with the sorts of their domain\\nand range) and predicates (with the sorts of their domains and the sort bool as\\nrange). In addition, functions can be restricted to be injective, bijective, . . . This\\nallows to express the n-queens problem very concisely as:\\n\\nD = {1..n}\\n\\npos : D → D (bijection)\\n\\nabs(pos(X1)− pos(X2)) 6= X2 −X1 ← X1 < X2.\\n\\nThe first line declares D as a sort with interpretation consisting of the set of\\nintegers 1 to n. The following line introduces the function pos/1 as a bijection\\nfrom D to D. Hence, the range of the function is a permutation of its domain.\\nThis function represents the column positions of the queens. The only remaining\\nconstraint is that queens have to be on different diagonals. This is expressed by\\nthe formula on the third line using the predefined functions abs/1 and −/2. Due\\nto symmetry, one need only to verify the constraint for pairs of queens X1, X2\\n\\nsuch that X1 < X2.\\n\\nSolutions are given by the interpretation of the pos/1 function in the models\\nof this theory. In principle, this approach is applicable on any CSP problem by\\nrepresenting the CSP variables by logical constants. However, in most cases, CSP\\nvariables are just an encoding of some attribute of a set of first order objects,\\nsuch as the position of a queen or the color of a node in a graph. In such cases,\\nthere is no need to introduce the CSP variable. The attribute can be represented\\ndirectly as a function or predicate on these objects (e.g. pos).\\n\\nAs the domains of all sorts are finite, SEM first computes the grounding\\nof the theory and then uses backtracking combined with various inference and\\nsimplification rules to guide the search for models [24].\\n\\n2.3 Stable Logic Programming\\n\\nIn [14], Niemelä proposes logic programming with the stable model semantics [6]\\nas a constraint logic programming paradigm. The underlying idea is to represent\\na problem as a set of rules, each rule being the declarative expression of a piece\\nof knowledge about the problem domain and such that the stable models of the\\nwhole program are constrained to be solutions of the problem.\\n\\nThe smodels system [15] is an efficient implementation of the stable model\\nsemantics. ',\n",
       "                'It works with propositional rules and a special pre-processing program\\nis used for grounding strongly range restricted logic programs. The implementa-\\ntion combines bottom-up inference with backtracking search and employs pow-\\nerful pruning methods. A recent extension of the system [16] introduces choice\\nrules:\\n\\nl {l1, l2, . . . ln} u← B.\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere l1, l2, . . . ln are literals. The semantics of such a rule is that if the body B\\nis true then at least l and at most u literals among li should be true in a stable\\nmodel of the program.\\n\\nFollowing [14] and [16], the program for the n-queens problems can be for-\\nmulated as:\\n\\nd(1..n).\\n\\n1 {pos(X, Y ) : d(Y )} 1← d(X).\\n1 {pos(X, Y ) : d(X)} 1← d(Y ).\\n\\n← d(X1), d(Y1), d(X2), d(Y2), pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2),\\nX1 < X2, X2 −X1 = abs(Y1 − Y2).\\n\\nSolutions are given by the pos(i, j) atoms in the stable models of the program.\\nThe first line defines that d/1 is a domain with elements 1..n with n the size of\\nthe board. The first choice rule is used to define the solution space of the problem\\nby stating that for each X in the domain d(X), there exists exactly one Y such\\nthat pos(X, Y ) is true. The colon notation denotes an expansion of pos(X, Y )\\nfor every value of Y . Similarly, the second choice rule expresses that there is\\nexactly one queen on each column. The last rule defines the final constraint of\\nthe problem: no two queens on the same diagonal. Again, the “<” constraints in\\nthese rules eliminate instances which are redundant due to symmetry. The main\\ndifference with the first order logic specification is that the mapping between\\nqueens and their position is now represented by a predicate. Declaring that this\\npredicate represents a bijective function is succinctly expressed by the two choice\\nrules.\\n\\n2.4 Abduction\\n\\nAbductive logic programming [8] extends the logic programming paradigm with\\nabductive reasoning. An abductive logic program has three components: (1) a\\nlogic program P , (2) a set of predicates A called abducibles or open predicates,\\nand (3) a set of integrity constraints I. The abducibles are predicates not defined\\nin the program. The task of an abductive system is to find a set ∆ of ground\\nabducible atoms such that the integrity constraints are true in the logic program\\nconsisting of P ∪∆; formally: P ∪∆ |= I.\\n\\nKakas and Michael proposed an integration of CLP and an abductive logic\\nprogramming system [9]. Originally, it was defined only for definite programs\\nand integrity constraints and in [10] it was extended to deal with negation as\\nfailure through abduction in a similar way as in [5]. One restriction of ACLP\\nis that integrity constraints need to be of the form ← a(X̄), B, where a is an\\nabducible. As we will see, this forces sometimes to reformulate some constraints\\nby an additional recursion. Such restrictions are not present in SLDNFAC [3], a\\nmore recent integration of an abductive system with CLP that is based on the\\nmore general abductive procedure SLDNFA [2].\\n\\n\\n\\nThe SLDNFAC system uses ID-Logic [1] as specification language which is\\ntransformed into an abductive logic program by using a Lloyd-Topor transfor-\\nmation. The specification of the n-queens problem is:\\n\\nd(1..n).\\n\\nopen function(pos(d, d)).\\n\\nY1 6= Y2 ∧X2 −X1 6= Y2 − Y1 ∧X2 −X1 6= Y1 − Y2\\n\\n⇐ pos(X1, Y1) ∧ pos(X2, Y2) ∧X1 < X2.\\n\\nThe first line of the program defines d/1 as a domain predicate with the integers\\n1..n as elements (defining rows and columns). The next line states that the\\npredicate pos/2 represents an open function in the defined domain. It is used to\\nrepresent the column position of a queen in a row. Finally there is a constraint\\nsaying that two queens can not be on the same column and diagonal. This\\nrepresentation is almost identical to the FOL specification of section 2.2. The\\nmain difference is that the open function is represented by a predicate.\\n\\nAs mentioned, ACLP does not allow function declarations. Consequently, the\\nfact that pos predicate represents a function must be expressed by explicit con-\\nstraints. A standard way to axiomatize that the abductive predicate pos(X, Y )\\nshould be true for each X in the domain d(X) is by using the following rule and\\nintegrity constraints:\\n\\nhas pos(X)← d(Y ), pos(X, Y ).\\n← d(X), not has pos(X).\\n\\nUnfortunately, the integrity constraint does not satisfy the ACLP’s restriction\\nthat at least one positive abductive atom should occur in it. Hence, these axioms\\nhave to be reformulated using a recursive program which generates a position\\nfor each queen. The specification for the ACLP system is:\\n\\nA = {pos/2}\\n\\nproblem(N)← nqueens(N, N).\\nnqueens(0, N).\\nnqueens(X, N)← X > 0, Y in 1..N, pos(X, Y ),\\n\\nXnext is X − 1, nqueens(Xnext, N).\\n\\nattack(X1, Y1, X2, Y2)← Y1 = Y2.\\nattack(X1, Y1, X2, Y2)← Y1 + X1 = Y2 + X2.\\nattack(X1, Y1, X2, Y2)← Y1 −X1 = Y2 −X2.\\n\\n← pos(X1, Y1), pos(X2, Y2), X1 < X2, attack(X1, Y1, X2, Y2).\\n\\nThe n-queens problem is solved by solutions of the abductive query← problem(n).\\n',\n",

Graph-coloring problems generated with these\\nparameters are difficult.\\n\\n\\n\\n~joe/Coloring/Generators/generate.html. We applied the systems in a se-\\nquence of experiments with graphs of increasing size and constant number of\\ncolors. We have modified only one parameter of the problem namely the number\\nof vertices. Figure 1 gives the results of solving the problem with the different\\nsystems. Both axes are plotted in a logarithmic scale. On the x-axis we have put\\nthe number of vertices. Not surprisingly, CLP is the fastest system. The times\\nfor smodels is second best on this problem. We assume it is in part because of\\nthe very concise formulation. Using the so called technique of rules with excep-\\ntions [14], the two rules needed to describe the space of candidate solutions also\\nencode the constraint that the color is a function of the vertex. Hence there is\\nonly one other rule, namely the constraint that two adjacent vertices must have\\na different color. The difference with CLP is almost two orders of magnitude\\nfor the largest problems. The times reported for smodels do not include the\\ntime for grounding the problem, these times only consist of a small part of the\\ntotal time. Grounding the problem for 650 nodes takes only 10 seconds, whereas\\nsolving the problem takes over 100 seconds. SLDNFAC is slightly worse than\\nsmodels. Although meta-interpretation overhead tends to increase with prob-\\nlems size, the difference with smodels grows very slowly. The model generator\\nSEM deteriorates much faster and runs out of memory for the larger problems.\\nThe fact that it grounds the whole theory is a likely explanation. The differ-\\nence with smodels supports the claim that smodels has better techniques for\\ngrounding. ACLP performs substantially worse than SLDNFAC and also dete-\\nriorates faster. The difference is likely due to the function-specification available\\nin SLDNFAC. Contrary to ACLP, SLDNFAC exploits the knowledge that the\\nabducible encodes a function to reduce the number of explicitly stored integrity\\nconstraints.\\n\\n3.3 N-Queens\\n\\nFigure 2 gives the running times for the different systems for finding a first\\nsolution. Both axes are plotted on a linear scale. The time consumed while\\ngrounding is again not included in the graph (for 18 queens, half a second).\\nAgain, CLP gives the best results. SLDNFAC is second best and, although meta-\\ninterpretation overhead increases with problem size, deteriorates very slowly.\\nACLP is third2, with a small difference, probably due to the lack of the function-\\nspecification mentioned in the section above. The next one is SEM. It runs out\\nof memory for large problems (it needs about 120MB for 27 queens). smodels\\n\\nperforms very poorly on this problem, in particular when compared with its\\nperformance on the graph coloring problem. It is well-known that to obtain good\\nresults for computing the first solution for the n-queens problem, a good search\\nheuristic is needed, like the first fail principle used by the systems based on CLP.\\nWe believe that the bad performance of smodels is explained by the absence of\\n\\n2 The results with ACLP are substantially better than those in the previous paper [17].\\nThis is due to the removal of a redundant and time consuming complete consistency\\ncheck after the processing of each new CLP constraint.\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n8\\n\\n10\\n\\n10 15 20 25 30\\n\\nT\\nim\\n\\ne \\n(s\\n\\nec\\n.)\\n\\nQueens\\n\\nN-Queens\\n\\nACLP\\nSLDNFAC\\n\\nSEM\\nCLP\\n\\nsmodels\\n\\nFig. 2.

The y-axis is plot-\\nted on a logarithmic scale. The CLP, ACLP and SLDNFAC systems are based\\non the same finite domain constraint solver, so their convergence is not unex-\\npected. Indeed, the abductive system generates a constraint problem which is\\nequivalent to the problem generated by the CLP program and no backtracking\\noccurs in the abductive system. Hence, its overhead becomes ignorable. Also\\nthe SEM system converges to the same performance as CLP (but runs out of\\nmemory for big problems). In this experiment, the smodels system performs\\nmuch better but is still the slowest system. A likely reason for this is that the\\nnumber of propositional variables in the n-queens problem grows quadratically\\nwith the problem size, in contrast with the graph coloring problem where the\\nnumber of variables grows only linearly (because of a constant number of colors).\\nConsequently, the grounding grows faster for this problem. The CLP consistency\\ntechniques seem to be much less sensitive to the domain size, and this carries\\nover to the abductive systems which reduce the problem to a CLP problem and\\nthen use the CLP solver to search for the solution.\\n\\n3.4 A Real World Problem\\n\\nA Belgian electricity company has a number of power plants divided in geo-\\ngraphic areas. Each power plant has a number of power generating units, each of\\nwhich must receive a given number (usually 1 or 2) of preventive maintenances\\nwith a fixed duration in the course of one year. The computational problem is to\\nschedule these maintenances according to some constraints and optimality crite-\\nria. Some of the constraints are: some time slots are prohibited for maintenance\\nfor some units; for each power plant, there is an upper limit on the total number\\nof units in maintenance per week for reasons of availability of personnel; some\\nof the maintenances are fixed in advance, . . . The objective of the problem is to\\nfind a schedule that maximizes the minimal weekly reserve, which is the sum\\nof the capacity of all units not in maintenance minus the expected weekly peak\\nload.\\n\\nThis is a rather difficult problem in several aspects. Firstly, the specification\\nuses aggregate expressions like cardinality and sum (e.g. for each area, there is\\nan upper limit to the total capacity for units in maintenance per week). Only\\nCLP, smodels and SLDNFAC support some form of aggregates and only these\\nsystems were used in our experiment. Also, the search space is very large, as\\nthere are 56 maintenances to be scheduled in 52 weeks which makes about 5652\\n\\ncombinations3. The company provided a set of constraints for which the optimal\\nsolution was known to have a minimal week reserve of 2100 (100%). The three\\nsystems found correct schedules but none was able to find this optimal solution.\\n\\n3 The maintenances with duration of more than one week cannot be scheduled in week\\n52, hence this number is only an upper approximation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis application was first considered in a context of a master’s thesis [18] and\\nthen reported in [4], where a first attempt was done for integrating the SLDNFA\\nproof procedure with the CLP system ROPE [23, 22]. This early system needed\\n24 hours to reduce the problem to a constraint store. Later on, in [22] several\\ndifferent direct encodings in CLP of the problem were presented and compared.\\nRecently, [21] discussed an extension of the SLDNFAC system with aggregate\\nfunctions and this problem was used as a benchmark.\\n\\nThe first version of the smodels system did not support aggregate expres-\\nsions. A more recent version of the system added a limited support for rules\\nwith a body consisting of a single cardinality or sum constraint [16] and allowed\\nus to specify the problem. However, these aggregate constraints cannot be used\\nfor computing the sum or the cardinality of a set of atoms and we were not\\nable to express the optimization function. By setting increasing lower bounds on\\nthe reserve capacity, branch and bound can be simulated manually. It should be\\nnoted that, because of the very large size of the problem, the specification of the\\nproblem in the smodels system had to be redesigned with special care in order\\nto produce a ground program not exceeding the limits of the system.\\n\\nTable 1 summarizes the results of executing the problem with the different\\nsystems. The first row “Setup” gives the time used for pre-processing the problem\\nspecification. For the abductive systems, this is the time for reducing the high-\\nlevel specification to a set of constraints. For the smodels system this is the\\ntime for grounding the program. The rest of the rows give the times used by the\\nconstraint solver to find a solution with the given quality.

Rather than the 24h needed in the earlier version [4], the current\\nSLDNFAC procedure only needs 45 seconds for reducing the problem and about\\n15 minutes for finding a solution of level 2050 (97.6%). A solution with reserve\\ncapacity of 2030 (96.5%) was found in less than two minutes. Note that the\\n\\n4 Without using global constraints, like cumulative.\\n\\n\\n\\ntimings for a solution with a reserve capacity of 1900 up to 2030 are similar.\\nThis is explained by the fact that in the five cases the same solution with reserve\\ncapacity of 2030 was computed. The small differences in timings are due to\\nnoise in the measurements. Strange enough, CLP deteriorates when it reaches\\na solution for a reserve capacity of 2050 whereas the SLDNFAC solution does\\nnot. This must be due to the fact that the constraint store built by the CLP\\nsolution differs from the one built by the SLDNFAC solution. This is accidental:\\nin general, constraint stores constructed by a hand made CLP program are more\\nefficient than the ones computed by SLDNFAC. The smodels system needed\\n40 seconds for grounding and the best solution we were able to find was 1900\\n(90.5%) in 8 seconds. We did not find better solutions in reasonable time.\\n\\n4 Conclusion\\n\\nFinite domain CLP is widely accepted as an excellent tool for CSP solving.\\nHowever CLP programs have drawbacks from the point of view of knowledge\\nrepresentation. As explained in Section 2.1, the variables of the CSP have to be\\norganized in a data structure and “procedural” code is required to create this\\ndata structure and to set up the constraints. This level of indirection increases\\nthe conceptual distance between the program and the problem and makes pro-\\ngrams less declarative. Recently, several attempts have been made to introduce\\nformalisms allowing more declarative formalizations. They are based on stable\\nmodel semantics [11, 13, 14] and on abduction [9, 10, 3]. Although these systems\\nhave an expressivity beyond what is needed to describe a CSP (they address\\nnon-monotonic reasoning while CSP solving requires only negation of primitive\\nconstraints), it is worthwhile to compare these systems with CLP which is state\\nof the art for CSP solving. Because both stable models and abduction express\\nsolutions to problems as models of their theory, we have also included first or-\\nder model generators in our study [24]. As argued in Section 2, these three\\napproaches are better than CLP from knowledge representation point of view,\\nthe formalizations are more natural, more readable, conceptually closer to the\\nproblem, in short they are more declarative than CLP programs. Which one of\\nthe three discussed mechanisms is the most declarative is likely a matter of taste\\nand familiarity.\\n\\nInevitably there is a price to be paid for these higher level descriptions. None\\nof the “declarative” systems experimented with comes close to the performance\\nlevel of CLP. This result holds although the CLP system is not favored by\\nthe problem choice. Indeed, in both graph coloring and n-queens problem, all\\nconstraints are disequality constraints which are known to give little propagation.\\n\\nOur experiments show that first order model generators do not scale well\\nand run out of memory for large problem instances even though the size of the\\nground program is smaller compared to smodels. We think that this is not\\nan inherent limitation of the approach but rather that such systems were writ-\\nten with the goal of fast performance and this is visible in our experiemnts. In\\ncontrast, smodels runs in linear space wrt the size of the grounding [15] and\\n\\n\\n\\nwas able to solve all problem sizes. Of the two abductive systems, SLDNFAC\\nsupports a substantially richer formalism and is performing slightly better than\\nACLP. As the two systems follow more or less the same strategy of top-down\\nreduction of integrity constraints and of forwarding the reduced ones to the CLP\\nsolver and as both are implemented as a Prolog meta-interpreter, the difference\\nseems to be mainly due to the support of function specifications. The fact that\\nthe SLDNFAC meta-interpreter outperforms SEM (a fine tuned C implementa-\\ntion) on both problems and compares very well with the C++ implementation of\\nsmodels (it is much better on the n-queens problem while it reaches almost the\\nsame performance on the graph coloring problem) suggest that its overall strat-\\negy is the best one of the three systems for CSP solving. Also the experiments\\nwith the large scheduling problem suggest this: the setup time is acceptable and\\ndifferences in search time seem to be due to differences in the order of traversing\\nthe search space. While the difference with CLP is substantial, a low level imple-\\n',\n",

However, SLDNFA, the procedure underlying SLDNFAC, is\\ncomplex, hence building a direct implementation is a hard task. We believe the\\ndevelopment of such a system is a worthwhile topic for future research.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nNikolay Pelov, Emmanuel De Mot and Marc Denecker are supported by the\\nGOA project LP+.

Constraint Logic Programming (CLP)\\n(see e.g. [13]) is an emerging software technology with growing number of applications. Data\\nflow in constraint programs is not explicit, and for this reason the concept of a slice and the slicing\\ntechniques of imperative languages are not directly applicable. Also, implicit data flow makes the\\nunderstanding of program behaviour rather difficult. Thus program analysis tools explaining data\\nflow to the user could be of great practical importance. This paper presents a prototype tool based on\\nthe slice concept applied to CLP.\\n\\nIntuitively a program slice with respect to a specific variable at some program point contains\\nall those parts of the program that may affect the value of the variable (backward slice) or may be\\naffected by the value of the variable (forward slice). Slicing algorithms can be classified according\\nto whether they only use statically available information (static slicing), or compute those statements\\nwhich influence the value of a variable occurrence for a specific program input (dynamic slice). The\\nslice provides a focus for analysis of the origin of the computed values of the variable in question. In\\nthe context of CLP the intuition remains the same, but the concept of slice requires precise definition\\nsince the nature of CLP computations is different from the nature of imperative computing.\\n\\nSlicing techniques for logic programs have been discussed in [5, 14, 19]. CLP extends logic\\nprogramming with constraints. This is a substantial extension and the slicing of CLP program has, to\\nour knowledge, not yet been addressed by other authors. Novel contributions presented in this paper\\nare:\\n\\n• A precise formulation of the slicing problem for CLP programs. We first define a concept of\\nslice for a set of constraints, which is then used to define slices of derivation trees, representing\\nstates of CLP computations. Then we define slices of a program in terms of the slices of its\\nderivation trees.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlicing of Constraint Logic Programs 3\\n\\n• Slicing techniques for CLP. We present slicing techniques that make it possible to construct\\nslices according to the definitions. The techniques are based on a simple analysis of variable\\nsharing and groundness.\\n\\n• A prototype dynamic slicer. A tool implementing the proposed techniques and some experi-\\nments with its use are briefly described.\\n\\nThe precisely defined concepts of slice gives a solid foundation for development of slicing tech-\\nniques. The prototype tool, including some visualisation facilities, helps the user in better under-\\nstanding of the program and in (manual) search for errors. Integration of this tool with more advanced\\ndebuggers is a topic of future work.\\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines some basic concepts which are then used\\nin Section 3 to formulate the problem of slicing. Section 4 presents and justifies a declarative for-\\nmalization of CLP slicing, based on a notion of dependency relation. Section 5 discusses a dynamic\\nbackward slicing technique, and the use of directionality information for reducing the size of slices.\\nOur prototype tool is described in Section 6, together with results of some experiments. Section 7\\n',\n",
       "                'then discusses relations to other work. Finally in Section 8 we present our conclusions and sugges-\\ntions for future work.\\n\\n2 Constraint Logic Programs\\n\\nThe cornerstone of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) [9, 13] is the notion of constraint. Con-\\nstraints are formulae constructed with some constraint predicates with a predefined interpreta-\\ntion. A typical example of a constraint is a linear arithmetic equation or inequality with rational\\ncoefficients where the constraint predicate used is equality interpreted over rational numbers, e.g.\\nX − Y = 1. The variables of a constraint range over the domain of interpretation. A valuation of\\na set S of variables is a mapping θ from S to the interpretation domain. A set of constraints C is\\nsatisfiable if there exists a valuation θ for the set of variables occurring in C, such that θ(C) holds\\nin the constraint domain.\\n\\nA constraint logic program is a set of clauses of the form h : −b1, ..., bn, n ≥ 0 , where\\nh, b1, ..., bn are atomic formulae. The predicates used to construct b1, ..., bn are either constraint\\npredicates or other predicates (sometimes called defined predicates). The predicate of h is a defined\\npredicate. A goal is a clause without h. This syntax extends logic programs with the possibility of\\nincluding constraints into the clauses.\\n\\nExample 1 In the following constraint program the equality constraint and symbols of arithmetic\\noperations are interpreted over the domain of rational numbers. This simple example is chosen to\\nsimplify the forthcoming illustration of slicing concepts and techniques. The constraints are distin-\\nguished by the curly brackets {}.\\n\\np(X,Y,Z):- {X-Y=1}, q(X,Y), r(Z).\\nq(U,V):- {U+V=3}.\\nr(42).\\n\\nSlicing refers to computations. Abstractly, a computation can be seen as construction of a tree,\\nfrom renamed instances of clauses. We explain briefly the idea discussed formally in [3].\\n\\nIntuitively, a clause c can be seen as a tree with root h head and leaves b1, ..., bn body atoms. If\\nthe predicate of bi appears in the head of a clause c′ then a renamed copy c′′ of c′ can be composed\\nwith c by attaching the head of c′′ to bi. This implicitly adds equality constraints for the corresponding\\narguments of the atoms. This process can be repeated for the leaves of the resulting tree. More\\nformally this is captured by the following notion. A skeleton for a program P is a labeled ordered\\ntree with the root labeled by a goal clause and with the nodes labeled by (renamed) clauses of the\\nprogram; some leaves may instead be labeled ”?” in which case they are called incomplete nodes.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 AADEBUG 2000\\n\\nEach non-leaf node has as many children as the non-constraint atoms of its body. The head predicate\\nof the i-th child of a node is the same as the predicate of the i-th non-constraint body atom of the\\nclause labeling the node.\\n\\nFor a given skeleton S the set C(S) of constraints, which will be called the set of constraints of\\nS, consists of :\\n\\n• the constraints of all clauses labeling the nodes of S\\n\\n• all equations ~x = ~y where ~x are the arguments of the i-th body atom of the clause labeling a\\nnode n of S, and ~y are the arguments of the head atom of the clause labeling the i-th child of\\nn. (No equation is created if the i-th child of n is an incomplete node).\\n\\nA derivation tree for a program P is a skeleton for P whose set of constraints is satisfiable. If the\\nskeleton is complete (i.e. it has no incomplete node) the derivation tree is called a proof tree. Figure\\n1 shows a complete skeleton tree for the program in Example 1.\\n\\nq(U,V) :- {U + V = 3}\\n\\np(X,Y,Z) :- {X - Y = 1}, q(X,Y), r(Z)\\n\\nr(42)\\n\\nFigure 1: A skeleton for the CLP program of Example 1.\\n\\nThe set of constraints of this skeleton is: C(S) = {X − Y = 1, X = U, Y = V, U + V = 3, Z =\\n42} and it is satisfiable. Thus the skeleton is a proof tree.\\n\\nFor the presentation of the slicing techniques we need to refer to program positions and to\\nderivation tree positions. A slice is defined with respect to some particular occurrence of a variable\\n(in a program or derivation tree), and positions are used to identify these ocurrences. Positions also\\nidentify arguments of the atomic formulae and their subterms.\\n\\nTo define the notion of position we assume that some standard way of enumeration of the nodes\\nof any given tree T is adopted. The indices of the nodes of T are called positions of T and the set of\\nall positions is denoted Pos(T ). Each position determines a unique subtree of T . On the other hand,\\nT may have several identical subtrees T0 at different positions.\\n\\nThis notation extends also for atomic formulae and terms, where the positions determine unique\\nsubterms. A position of a term such that the corresponding subterm is a variable will be called a\\nvariable position. We extend the adopted way of enumeration to clauses and programs; a program\\nposition is an index in this enumeration that identifies an atomic formula or a term in a clause of the\\nprogram.\\n\\n',\n",
       "                'A single clause may be treated as a one-clause program. As discussed above, a derivation tree\\nhas its nodes labeled by renamed variants of program clauses. By a derivation tree position of a\\nderivation tree T we mean a pair (i1, i2), where i1 is a position of the skeleton of T and i2 is a\\nposition of the clause labeling node i1 in T . The set of all tree positions of a derivation tree T will be\\ndenoted by Pos(T ).\\n\\nRecall that each label of a derivation tree T is a variant of a program clause, or of a goal. There-\\nfore the positions of T can be mapped in a natural way into the corresponding program positions.\\n\\nSimilary, each occurrence of a variable X in C(T ) (the constraint set of T ) originates from a\\nvariable position of X in T . Thus variable positions of T can be linked to the related constraints of\\nC(T ).\\n\\nLet P be a set of positions of T , and ΨT (P) the set of all variables that appear in the terms on\\npositions in P . In this way P identifies the subset CP of C(T ) consisting of all constraints including\\nvariables in ΨT (P).\\n\\nExample 2 Consider the derivation tree of Figure 1.\\nLet (P) = { derivation tree positions of the atom q(X, Y )} ⊆ Pos(T ).\\nThen ΨT (P) = {X, Y } and CP = {X − Y = 1, X = U, Y = V }.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlicing of Constraint Logic Programs 5\\n\\n3 The Slicing Problem\\nGiven a variable X in a CLP program we would like to find a fragment of the program that may\\naffect the value of X . This is rather imprecise, hence our objective is to formalize this intuition. We\\nfirst define the notion of a slice of a satisfiable set of constraints. A variable X in a derivation tree T\\nhas its valuations [9, 13] restricted by the set of constraints of T (which is satisfiable), so our second\\ntask will be to define a slice of a derivation tree, and finally a slice of a program (see Figure 2).\\n\\nX\\nslice slice slice\\n\\nφ\\n\\nProof Tree ProgramConstraint store\\n\\nposition\\nproof tree program \\n\\nposition\\nvariable\\ninstance\\n\\nFigure 2: A slice of a constraint set, a proof tree and a program.\\n\\nLet C be a set of constraints. Intuitively we would like to remove all constraints of the set that do\\nnot restrict the valuation of a given variable. The binding of a variable X to a value v is said to be a\\nsolution of C with respect to X iff there exists a valuation ν such that ν(X) = v and ν satisfies C.\\nThe set of all solutions of C with respect to X will be denoted by Sol(X, C).\\n\\nDefinition 1 A slice of a satisfiable constraint set C with respect to X is a subset S ⊆ C such that\\nSol(X, S) = Sol(X, C).\\n\\nIn other words the set of all solutions of a slice S of C with respect to X is equal to the set of all\\nsolutions of C with respect to X . Definition 1 gives implicitly a notion of minimal slice: it is a slice\\nS of C such that if we further reduce S to S ′, then Sol(X, S ′) is different from Sol(X, C). Notice\\nthat the whole set C is a slice of itself, and that the definition does not provide any hint about how\\nto find a minimal slice. The problem of finding minimal slices may be undecidable in general, since\\nsatisfiability may be undecidable. So reasoning about minimality of the constructed slices seems only\\nbe possible in very restricted cases, and for some specific constraint domains. Our general technique\\nis domain independent but we show in Section 5 how the groundness information ( which may be\\nprovided by a specific constraint solver) can be used to reduce the size of the slices constructed by\\nthe general technique.\\n\\nWe now formulate the slicing problem for derivation trees. A derivation tree T is a skeleton with\\na set of constraints C(T ). The variables of C(T ) originate from positions of T . Let P be a set of\\npositions of T , i.e. P ⊆ Pos(T ). Then Ψ(P) identifies the variables of C(T ) with occurrences\\noriginating from positions in P . We denote by CP the set of all constraints of C(T ) that include\\nthese variables.\\n\\nDefinition 2 A slice of a derivation tree T with respect to a variable position of X is any subset P\\nof the positions of T such that CP is a slice of C(T ) with respect to X .\\n\\nThe intuition reflected by this definition is that the constraints connected with the positions of the\\ntree not included in a slice do not influence restrictions on the valuation of X imposed by the tree.\\nWe formalize this by referring to the formal notion of the slice of a set of constraints. Notice that any\\nsuperset of a slice is also a slice.\\n\\nFinally we define the notion of a CLP program slice with respect to a variable position. We\\nnotice that every position of a derivation tree T is a (renamed) copy of a program position or of a\\ngoal position. This provides a natural map ΦT of the positions of T into program positions and goal\\npositions. Corresponding to this definition of ΦT , for a program position q the set Φ−1\\n\\nT (q) contains\\nthose proof tree positions such that if r ∈ Φ−1\\n\\nT (q) then ΦT (r) = q.\\n\\n\\n\\n6 AADEBUG 2000\\n\\nDefinition 3 A slice of a CLP program P with respect to a program position q is any set S of\\n',\n",

This section presents a\\nrather straightforward sufficient condition for this. We provide here a “syntactic” approach to slicing\\nconstraint stores, proof trees and programs. The propositions follow easily from the definitions and\\nwill be stated without proof. More details can be found in the technical report [16].\\n\\n4.1 Slicing sets of constraints\\nWe use variable sharing between constraints as a basis for slicing sets of constraints. Let C be a\\nset of constraints, and vars(C) the set of all variables occurring in the constraints in C. Let X, Y\\nbe variables in vars(C). X is said to depend explicitly on Y iff both occur in a constraint c in C.\\nNotice that the explicit dependency relation is symmetric and reflexive but need not be transitive.\\n\\nDefinition 4 A dependency relation on vars(C) is the transitive closure of the explicit dependency\\nrelation.\\n\\nThe dependency relation on C will be denoted by depC . Notice that depC is an equivalence relation\\non vars(C). We map any equivalence class [X]depC\\n\\nto the subset CX of C that consists of all\\nconstraints that include variables in [X]dep. Then CX is a slice of C (see [16]).\\n\\nExample 3 For the set of constraints of Example 1 the dependency relation has two equivalence\\nclasses: {X, Y, U, V } and {Z} and gives the following slice of C with respect to X:\\n\\nCX = {X − Y = 1, X = U, Y = V, U + V = 3}\\n\\n4.2 Slicing of derivation trees\\nWe defined the concept of slice for a derivation tree by referring to the notion of slice of a set\\nof constraints. To construct slices of derivation trees we introduce a dependency relation on the\\npositions of a derivation tree. We now define a direct dependency relation ∼T on Pos(T ). It can be\\nrelated to the dependency relation on vars(C(T )) [16] and hence can be used for slicing T .\\n\\nDefinition 5 Let T be a derivation tree. The direct dependency relation ∼T on Pos(T ) is defined as\\nfollows:\\nα ∼T β iff one of the following conditions holds:\\n\\n1. α and β are positions in an occurrence of a clause constraint (constraint edge).\\n\\n2. α and β are positions in a node equation (transition edge).\\n\\n3. α and β are positions in an occurrence of a term (functor edge).\\n\\n\\n\\nSlicing of Constraint Logic Programs 7\\n\\n4. α and β share a variable (local edge).\\n\\nObserve that the relation is both reflexive and symmetric. The transitive closure ∼∗\\n\\nT of the direct\\ndependency relation will be called the dependency relation on Pos(T ). So ∼∗\\n\\nT is an equivalence\\nrelation.\\n\\nProposition 1 Let T be a proof tree and let α be a variable position of T . Then [α]∼∗\\n\\nT\\nis a slice of T\\n\\nwith respect to α.\\n\\n4.3 Slicing of CLP programs\\nThis section defines a dependency relation on the positions of the program and then makes use of it\\nin constructing program slices. Recall that each position of a derivation tree T “originates” from a\\nposition of the selected program P . This is formally captured by the map Φ : Pos(T ) → Pos(P ).\\nThe dependency relation ∼P on Pos(P ) we are going to define should reflect dependency relations\\nin all proof trees of P . More precisely, whenever α ∼T β in some tree T we would also like to have\\nΦ(α) ∼P Φ(β).\\n\\nDefinition 6 Let P be a CLP program. The direct dependency relation ∼P on Pos(P ) is defined as\\nfollows: α ∼P β iff at least one of the following conditions holds:\\n\\n1. α and β are positions of the same constraint (constraint edge).\\n\\n2. α is a position of the head atom of a clause c and β is a position of a body atom of a clause d\\nand both atoms have the same predicate symbol (transition edge).\\n\\n3. α and β belong to the same argument of a function (functor edge).\\n\\n4. α and β are in the same clause and have a common variable (local edge).\\n\\nThe dependency relation of a program can be represented as a graph.\\n\\n \\n\\nlocal edge\\n\\ntransition edge\\n\\nconstraint edge\\n\\n    q( U, V )\\n\\np( X, Y, Z )  :-      { X - Y = 1 }       q( X, Y )         r( Z )\\n\\n:-      { U + V = 3 }                                     r( 42 )\\n\\nFigure 3: Program dependence represented in graphical form and the backward slice with respect to\\nZ in p(X,Y,Z))\\n\\nComparing the definitions of ∼T and ∼P one can check that whenever α ∼T β in some tree T\\nof P then Φ(α) ∼P Φ(β) as well. Consequently, for any proof tree T (α ∼∗\\n\\nT β) ⇒ Φ(α) ∼∗\\n\\nP Φ(β).\\nThe transitive closure ∼∗\\n\\n',\n",

The following result shows how ∼∗\\n\\nP\\n\\ncan be used for the slicing of P .\\n\\n\\n\\n8 AADEBUG 2000\\n\\nProposition 2 Let P be a CLP program and let β be a position of P .

For the program in Example 1 ∼∗\\n\\nP has two equivalence classes. One of\\nthem includes all occurrences of Z and the occurrence of the constant 42. The other consists of the\\nremaining positions.\\n\\nDefinition 6 with Proposition 2 give a method for constructing program slices without referring\\nto proof trees. Thus, we obtain a static slicing technique for CLP. The mapping Φ was introduced\\nto argue about correctness of this technique. These results also confirm the correctness of the slicing\\nalgorithm in [5] since a logic program can be viewed as a constraint logic program.\\nThe proposition shows that the concept of dependency relation on program positions provides a\\nsufficient condition for slicing a CLP program. However, the slice obtained may be quite large,\\nsometimes it may even include the whole constraint store.\\n\\nWe propose two ways for addressing this problem. On one hand, improvement is possible if we\\nhandle the so called “calling context problem”[7] which appears when the same predicate is called\\nfrom two different clauses. As we explained in [16] it is possible to adapt to CLP the solution\\nproposed by Horwitz et. al [7] for procedural languages. Another way of reducing the size of slices\\nis to infer and to take into account information about proliferation of ground instantiations during the\\nexecution of the program. A directional dynamic slicing technique based on this idea is presented in\\nthe next section.\\n\\n5 Dynamic directional slicing\\n\\nAll the dependency relations discussed so far were symmetric. Intuitively, for a constraint c(X, Y )\\na restriction imposed on valuations of X usually influences admissible valuations of Y and vice\\nversa. However if c(X, Y ) belongs to a satisfiable constraint set C and some other constraints of C\\nmake X ground then the slice of C with respect to X need not include c(X, Y ). For example, if\\nC = {X + 1 = 0, Y > X} is interpreted on the integer domain then {X + 1 = 0} is a slice of C\\nwith respect to X . This slice can be constructed by using information about groundness of variables\\noccurring in the dependency graph.\\n\\nThis section shows how to use groundness information in derivation tree slicing, that is in dy-\\nnamic slicing of CLP programs. It extends to CLP the ideas of dynamic slicing for logic programs\\npresented in [5]. In our approach groundness is captured by adding directionality information to\\ndependency graphs. The directed graphs show the propagation of ground data during the execution\\nof CLP programs, and these graphs can then be used to produce more precise slices. The groundness\\ninformation will be collected during the computation that constructs the derivation tree to be sliced.\\nThe proposed concepts are also applicable to the case of static slicing, where the groundness infor-\\nmation has to be inferred by static analysis of the program. This is however not discussed in this\\npaper.\\n\\n5.1 Groundness Annotations\\n\\nGroundness information associated with a derivation tree will be expressed as an annotation of its\\npositions. The annotation classifies the positions of a derivation tree or the positions of the CLP\\nprogram. The positions are classified as inherited (marked with ↓), synthesized (↑) and dual (l). An\\nannotation is partial if some positions are dual. Formally speaking, an annotation is a mapping µ\\nfrom the positions into the set {↓, ↑, l} [3].\\n\\nThe intended meaning of the annotation is as follows. An inherited position is a position which is\\nground at time of calling, that is when the equation involving this position is first created during the\\nconstruction of the derivation tree. A synthesized positions is a position which is ground at success,\\nthat is when the subtree having the position in its root label is completed in the computation process.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlicing of Constraint Logic Programs 9\\n\\nThe dual positions of a proof tree are those for which no groundness information is given, including\\nthose which are ground neither at call nor at success.\\n\\nThe annotations will be collected during the execution of the program. Alternatively, they may\\nbe inferred with some straightforward inference rules discussed in [16].\\n\\nWe now introduce the following auxiliary terminology relevant to the annotated positions of a\\nCLP program. The inherited positions of the head atoms and the synthesized positions of the body\\natoms are called input positions. Similarly, the synthesized positions of the head atoms and inherited\\npositions of the body atoms are called output positions. Note that dual positions are not strictly\\nclassified as input or output ones. ',\n",
       "                'Alternatively, if we say that a position is annotated as an output\\nwe mean that it is annotated as inherited provided it is a position in a body atom, or annotated as\\nsynthesized if it is a position of the head of a clause.\\n\\nExample 4 Consider the following CLP program:\\n\\n1. p(X,Y) :- r(X), q(X,Y).\\n2. r(3).\\n3. q(U,V) :- {U+V = 5}.\\n\\nThe corresponding annotated proof tree for the goal p(X, Y ) is presented in Figure 4, where the\\nactual positions have been replaced by I (the input positions) and by O (the output positions):\\n\\n) :- r(I 1. p(O  ,O ) , q(O  , I  ).\\n\\n3. q(I  , O ) : - {O , I  = O }.r(O 2. . )\\n\\nFigure 4: The annotated proof tree for Example 5\\n\\nThe annotation reflects groundness propagation during the computation, as discussed below. The\\nvariables X and Y of p(X, Y ) are annotated as output, since they are ground at success of p, and\\np(X, Y ) is a head atom. For the same reason the argument of the fact r(3) in node 2 is annotated as\\noutput. The variable U in the first argument of the predicate q(U, V ) in node 3 is ground at call, so it\\nis annotated as input, while V is ground at success of q so it is annotated as output.\\n\\nIn a CLP program groundness of a position depends generally on the used constraint solver.\\nMonitoring the execution, also in this case, we are able to annotate certain positions as inputs or\\noutputs. For example the indomain(X) constraint of CHIP instantiates X to a value in its domain,\\nso that X is an input position. Rational solvers can usually solve linear equations. For example in\\nthe rational constraint Y = 2 ∗ X + Z, X can be annotated input if Y an Z are output.\\n\\n5.2 Directional slicing of derivation trees\\nHaving input/output information for positions of a derivation tree, we then add directions to its de-\\npendence graph. The following definition describes how it can be achieved.\\n\\nDefinition 7 Directed Dependency Graph of a Proof Tree\\nLet T be a proof tree, TG = (TreePos(T ),∼T ) its proof tree dependence graph, then the directed\\ndependence graph of T (P ) can be defined as:\\nTDG = (TreePos(T ),→T ), where:\\n\\n• α →T (G) β if α ∼T (G) β is a transition edge, α is an output position and β is an input position\\n\\n• α →T (G) β if α ∼T (G) β is a local edge, α is an input position and β is an output position\\n\\n• α →T (G) β and β →T (G) α in every other case when α ∼T (G) β\\n\\n\\n\\n10 AADEBUG 2000\\n\\nFrom the definition of →T (G) assuming correctness of the annotation we find that if α is a position\\nof X in T and it is annotated as input or as output then C(T ) binds X to a single value. This value\\nis determined by the constraints connected with those positions that are in the set {β|β →∗\\n\\nT (G) α}.\\nThus we have:\\n\\nProposition 3 {β|β →∗\\n\\nT (G) α} is a slice of T with respect to α.\\n\\nThese slices are usually more precise than in the case when the groundness information is not\\nused.\\n\\nThe concept of directed dependency graph can be extended to programs and used for static slic-\\ning. This requires good methods for static groundness analysis to infer annotations for program\\npositions. Some suggestions for that can be found in [16].\\n\\n6 A Prototype Implementation\\n\\nWe developed a prototype in SICStus Prolog for dynamic backward slicing of constraint logic pro-\\ngrams written in SICStus. The tool handles a realistic subset of Prolog, including constructs such\\nas cut, if-then and or. The inputs of the slicing system are: the source code, a test case (a goal)\\nand (after the execution) the execution traces given by the Prolog interpreter. From this information\\nthe Directed Proof Tree Dependence Graph (Definition 7) may be constructed. The following three\\ntypes of slice algorithms were implemented (see Figure 5):\\n\\n1. Proof tree slice\\nIn this case the user chooses an argument position of the created Proof Tree, and the slice is\\nconstructed with respect to this proof tree position using the Directed Proof Tree Dependency\\nGraph (see Definition 7). This kind of slice is useful when the user is interested in the data\\ndependences of the Proof Tree.\\n\\n2. Dynamic slice\\nThis case is very similar to 1, but the constructed slice of the Proof Tree is mapped back to\\nthe program. This is the classic dynamic slice approach [12], as in the case of procedural\\nlanguages. So this slice provides a slice of the program.\\n\\n3. Program position slice\\nIn this case the user selects a program position. The system provides all instances of this\\nprogram position in the Proof Tree, creates the proof tree slice for every instance, then the\\nunion of these slices are constructed and mapped back to the program. So this algorithm also\\nprovides a slice of the program, which shows all dependences of a program position for a given\\ntest case.\\n\\nA graphical interface draws the proof tree (see Figure 7), marked with different colored nodes that are\\nin the Proof tree slice, and in the case of a dynamic slice and program position slice the corresponding\\nslice of the program is highlighted. The label of the nodes identify the nodes of the proof tree\\n',\n",
       "                'including the name of the predicate and the annotation of its arguments.\\n\\nIn the implementation we applied a very simple annotation technique: the inherited positions\\nwere those which were ground at the time of calling, while synthesized positions were those which\\nwere ground at success. This method provides precise annotation, because we continuously extract\\ninformation from the actual state of the constraint store. However, in the current implementation\\nslicing can only be done on argument positions. If an argument includes several variables it is not\\npossible to distinguish between them, which makes the constructed slice ”less precise” (compared\\nto the minimal slice). So, our aim is to improve the existing implementation, extend it to variable\\npositions.\\n\\nIn the present version of the tool the sliced proof tree corresponds to the first success branch of\\nthe SLD tree.

Each of them was executed with a number of test inputs to collect data\\nabout the relative size of a slice with respect to the proof tree, depending on the choice of the po-\\nsition. The selected application programs [9, 13] had different language structures (use of cut, or,\\nif-then, databases, compound constraint), and were of different size.\\n\\nThe summarized data of the test results on proof tree slicing is listed in Table 1.

This\\nmeans that in some computation step (i.e. in some derivation tree) a variable of the program is bound\\nin a way that does not conform to user expectations. A slice of the derivation tree with respect to\\nthis occurrence of the variable can be mapped into the text of the program and will identify a part of\\nthe program where the undesired binding was produced. This would provide a focus for debugging,\\nwhatever is the debugging technique used. Intersection of the slices produced for different runs of\\nthe buggy program may further narrow the focus.\\n\\nIn particular, our slicing technique can be combined with Shapiro’s algorithmic debugging [15],\\ndesigned originally for logic programs. As shown in [11] the slice of a derivation tree of a logic\\nprogram may reduce the number of queries of algorithmic debugger. This technique can also be\\napplied to the case of algorithmic debugging of CLP programs discussed in [19].\\n\\n\\n\\n12 AADEBUG 2000\\n\\nFigure 6: Comparison of the Proof Tree Slice, Dynamic Slice and the Program Position Slice.\\n\\n7 Related Work\\n\\nProgram slicing has been widely studied for imperative programs [4, 10, 8, 12, 7]. To our knowledge\\nonly a few papers have dealt with the problem of slicing logic programs, and slicing of constraint\\nlogic programs has not been investigated till now.\\n\\nWe provided a theoretical basis for the slicing of proof trees and programs starting from a se-\\nmantic definition of the constraint set dependence. This applies as well to the special case of logic\\nprograms (the Herbrand domain). In particular it justifies the slicing technique of Gyimóthy and\\nPaakki [5] developed to reduce the number of queries for algorithmic debugger and makes it possible\\nto extend the latter to the general case of CLP. The directional slicing of Section 5 is an extension of\\nthis technique to the general case of CLP.\\n\\nSchoening and Ducassé [14] proposed a backward slicing algorithm for Prolog which produces\\n',\n",
       "                'executable slices. For a target Prolog program they defined a slicing criterion which consists of a goal\\nof P and a set of argument positions Pa, along with a slice S as a reduced and executable program\\nderived from P . An executable slice is usually less precise but it may be used for additional test\\nruns. Hence the objectives of their work are somewhat different from ours, and their algorithm is\\napplicable to a limited subset of Prolog programs.\\n\\nIn [19] Zhao et al defined some static and dynamic slices of concurrent logic programs called\\nliteral dependence nets. They presented a new program representation called the argument depen-\\ndence net for concurrent logic programs to produce static slices at the argument level. There are\\nsome similarities between our slicing techniques and Zhao’s methods, since we also rely on some\\ndependency relations. However, the focus of our work has been on CLP not on concurrent logic\\nprograms, and our main aim has been a declarative formulation of the slicing problem whic provides\\na clear reference basis for proving the correctness of the proposed slicing methods.\\n\\nThe results of the ESPRIT Project DiSCiPl [2] show the importance of visualisation in the de-\\nbugging of constraint programs. Our tool provides a rudimentary visualisation of the sliced proof\\ntree. It was pointed out by Deransart and Aillaud [1] that abstraction techniques are needed in the\\nvisualisation of the search space. Program position slicing, if applied to all branches of the SLD-tree,\\nprovides yet another abstraction of the search space.\\n\\n 60 50 40 Proof tree slice 30 - IDynamic slice Program position slice 20 SLICE SIZE (%) 10 0 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 PROGRAMS \\n\\n\\n\\nSlicing of Constraint Logic Programs 13\\n\\nFigure 7: Displayed program and proof tree slices.\\n\\n8 Conclusions\\n\\nThe paper offers a precise declarative formulation of the slicing problem for CLP. It also gives a\\nsolid reference basis for deriving various techniques of slicing CLP programs in general and for\\nlogic programs treated as a special case. This technique was illustrated by deriving the directional\\ndata flow slicing technique for CLP, which is an extension of [5] applied to CLP. As a side effect, the\\nlatter, which was presented in somewhat pragmatic setting, obtains a theoretical justification.\\n\\nThe paper presents also a prototype slicing tool using this technique. The experiments with\\nthe tool show that the obtained slices were quite precise in some cases, and on average provided a\\nsubstantial reduction of the program.\\n\\nThe future work will focus on the application of slicing techniques to constraint programs de-\\nbugging. Two aspects being considered. Firstly, in the manual debugging of CLP programs it is\\nnecessary to support user with a tool that facilitates the understanding of the program. We believe\\nthat a future version of our slicer equipped with suitable visualisation features could be very suitable\\nfor this purpose. Secondly, the slicing of a derivation tree can often reduce the number of queries\\nin algorithmic debugging of logic programs [15]. (The algorithmic debugging technique has been\\nextended to CLP [17]).\\n\\nAs a first step in this direction we are going to integrate our CLP slicing tool with the IDTS\\n\\n DOTTY node(1,0,0,2,[i,o,i,0]) goal(prg,4) node(2,1,1,1,[i,o]} node(8,1,1,2, [1 ,- ]) goal(p,2) goal(q,2) f node(3,2,2,1,[i,o] node(6,2,2,2,[i]] \"node(9,8,2,1,[1,0]) node(14,8,2,2,[d]) goal( sum,2) goal(control,1) goal( sum,2) goal( {},1) node(4,3,3,1,[i,o]; node(5,3,3,2,[d]) goal( {},1) node(7,6,3,1,[i]) node( 10,9,3,1,[i,o]} node(13,9,3,2,[d]) goal(sum,2) goal({},1) goal( sum,2) goal( {},1) node(11,10,4,1,[1,0]) node(12,10,4,2,[d]) goal(sum,2) goal({},1) prec File Edit View Help ? : - use _module ( library (clpr) ) . prg (L1, Sum, L2 , DSum) : - p ( Ll, Sum) , q (L2, DSum) . p (Ll, Sum) : - sum (Ll, Sum) , control ( Sum) . control ( Sum) : - {Sum =< 100.0}, q (L2, DSum) : - sum ( L2, Sum2) , {DSum=2. 0*Sum2} . sum ( [], 0. 0) sum ( [X] Rem , Sum) : - sum (Rem, Suml ) {Sun =X+Sum1} Ready. \\n\\n\\n\\n14 AADEBUG 2000\\n\\nalgorithmic debugger [11], originally developed for pure logic programs.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe work of the first and second authors was supported by the grants OTKA T52721 and IKTA\\n8/99.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] P.

One must decide what exactly to trace and\\nhow to produce this trace. On the one hand, trace designs are too often guided by implementation\\nconcerns and are not as useful as they should be. On the other hand, an interesting trace which cannot\\nbe produced efficiently, is not very useful either.\\n\\nSome sort of instrumentation is required to produce the trace information. This instrumentation\\ncan be done at different levels, for example the user programs can be transformed at source or com-\\npiled levels. Another possibility is to plant trace hooks in the language interpreter or emulator. All\\nthese possibilities have their advantages and drawbacks, deciding for one is not straightforward. For\\nexample, source level transformation does not require to open the compiler sources and can be effi-\\ncient enough [DN00]. Instrumenting an interpreter is in general easier than working directly in the\\ncompiler and the loss in performance might be acceptable.\\n\\nIn M. Ronsse, K.

DUCASSÉ ET AL.\\n\\nHowever, in order to have at the same time a faithful and efficient enough tracer, people often\\ndecide to instrument the language emulator or the user compiled code. In both cases, they have to\\ndive deeply into non-obvious code. This is a tricky task, especially if the tracer developers have not\\nbeen involved in the development of the compiler. At this stage, it is necessary that the trace model is\\nstable. Instrumenting at low level requires a lot of tedious work, it is essential to know exactly what\\nis expected before starting.\\n\\nThe first stage of the design, namely deciding what to trace, is, therefore, critical. However, de-\\nciding what to trace out of the blue is not obvious. It is often when people see the output of a tracer\\nthat they can tell whether the information is relevant and helpful.\\n\\nTo solve this apparent contradiction, we have conceived a methodology that we have successfully\\napplied to the design and implementation of a real tracer:\\n\\n1. Design a formal specification of the trace model based on an abstraction of the operational\\nsemantics of the language.\\n\\n2. Derive a prototype tracer from this specification.\\n\\n3. Analyze the produced traces to update or validate the trace model. This analysis can be par-\\ntially automated.\\n\\n4. Implement an efficient tracer.\\n\\n5. Validate the efficient implementation using the prototype.\\n\\nAt each step, problems in the model or in implementations can be found. In that case one has to\\niterate the process.\\n\\nThe advantages of the approach are as follows. Firstly, the formal specification helps to produce a\\ntrace model which gives an accurate picture of the executions. When examining existing tracers, one\\n',\n",
       "                'too often has the feeling that they produce whatever information is easily available, hoping that the\\nusers will manage with the holes and the noise. While users often manage, mostly because they have\\nno other choice, we claim that tracers with clean semantics are much more helpful. Secondly, in our\\napproach the prototype is systematically derived from the trace model. It is therefore easy to produce\\nand the resulting traces are faithful to the model. The prototype can easily produce trace samples.\\nThirdly, analyzing the trace samples enables people to tune the trace model. When an automated\\ntrace analyzer is used, this analysis can be systematic and thorough. Fourthly, when the tracer devel-\\nopers reach the stage where they have to implement a low-level tracer, they know which information\\nis crucial and which one can be escaped. If implementation compromises have to be made, people\\nhave rational arguments to take their decisions. Lastly, comparing the actual output of the low-level\\nimplementation against the expected trace produced by the prototype is a good way to validate the\\nquality of the implementation.\\n\\nNote that the execution of the prototype tracer can afford to be slow. Indeed, it is used only at\\ndevelopment time for qualitative reasoning, firstly to tune the trace model, then to test the imple-\\nmentation. Furthermore it is meant to be used on small programs only. The only requirement of\\nthese programs is that they altogether exhibit all the characteristics of the traced language. In order\\nto test the performance of the final tracer, big programs have, of course, to be traced but with the\\nlow-level implementation not with the prototype.\\n\\nThe first three steps of this methodology had been applied to the retrospective design of a Prolog\\ntracer [JDR01]. The formal specification step enabled to specify a variety of existing trace models for\\nProlog which were shown to be minor variants of each others. The result was a unified view of nu-\\nmerous models which were initially proposed without much rationale to support them. Furthermore\\na number of implementation issues regarding variable identifiers were detected.\\n\\nFifth Int. Workshop on Automated and Algorithmic Debugging\\n\\n\\n\\nAADEBUG2003: RIGOROUS DESIGN OF TRACERS 173\\n\\nMore interestingly, we have used all the steps of the methodology to design from scratch a tracer\\nfor constraint logic programming over finite domains(CLP(FD) in the following). A detailed descrip-\\ntion of this tracer can be found in [LDD03]. The low-level tracer has been implemented inside the\\ncompiler of Gnu-Prolog [GP01] by somebody who did not previously know the implementation of\\nthe compiler. This experiment has been done within a project on visualization of constraint program\\nexecutions, with academic and industrial partners working on different platforms. Both the formal\\nspecification of the trace model and the prototyping capabilities have enabled us to discuss with all\\nthe partners of the project and to make sure that the designed trace is indeed matching the needs\\nof everybody. Some partners build graphical views [SA00], other provide explanations of failure\\nfor over-constrained problems [JB00]. They all work with parts of the specified trace. As the de-\\nsign of the trace model was not connected to a particular implementation we could design a model\\nwhich is generic enough to be specialized at low cost for two different styles of constraint satisfaction\\n(CSP [Lrg01] and CLP [Apt99]). Furthermore, some parts of the designed information, for example\\nthe list of variables and the constraint identifiers, have been proved essential for the quality of the\\nviews but they are not obvious to gather from the implementation in the emulator. Starting from the\\nformal specification and knowing that they were absolutely needed, made them not too difficult to\\nimplement. One can conjecture that, had we started to implement straightaway the low-level imple-\\nmentation, these kinds of information would probably have never been provided by the tracer. Not\\nsurprisingly, in the tracers of the CLP systems, Sicstus Prolog [ASBC02] and Ilog Solver [Ilo01], in\\norder to get the list of variables, one has to traverse a huge part of the trace. This is especially tedious\\nto do for users.\\n\\nThe contribution of this article is to propose a methodology to rigorously design and validate\\ntracer implementations. To our best knowledge, this had not been done before. This methodology\\nhas been successfully tested against the design and implementation of a real tracer.\\n\\nThe next sections present the methodology in more details and illustrate it with samples of the ex-\\nperiment done with the design, implementation and validation of a tracer for Gnu-Prolog. The expla-\\nnations are meant for readers with no previous knowledge of constraint solving. Section 2 presents\\nthe trace model formalization step. Section 3 describes how to systematically derive an instrumented\\nmeta-interpreter from the formal specification. ',\n",
       "                'Section 4 outlines the trace analysis step. In particular,\\nit briefly presents the connection to a trace analyzer and lists some interesting graphical views for\\nCLP(FD). Section 5 discusses the low-level implementation of tracers. Section 6 sketches the valida-\\ntion of the efficient tracer against the prototype implementation.\\n\\n2 Formal specification of a trace model\\n\\nThe first step of our methodology is to specify a trace model, namely what information about pro-\\ngram executions should be given. In our sequential language context, a trace is a sequence of events.\\nAn event represents an interesting execution step, it can be seen as an execution breakpoint to which\\ninformation is attached.\\n\\nMost specifications of trace models are informal, when they exist at all. However, an informal\\nspecification is prone to misinterpretation by both developers and users. Indeed, in order to denote\\nthe events of interest, one has first to be able to denote events, and this is not easy in an informal way.\\n\\nIn the following, we describe two ways that have been tried to provide a formal specification of\\ntrace model, firstly an existing operational semantics has been instrumented and secondly an abstract\\noperational semantics has been specified. We then give some details of the second experiment.\\n\\nFifth Int. Workshop on Automated and Algorithmic Debugging\\n\\n\\n\\n174 M.

Hence the computation events are clearly denoted. In such a case, it is relatively easy\\nto formally specify a trace model as shown by Jahier et al. with the Prolog tracer retro-specifica-\\ntion [JDR01]. There were already numerous operational semantics available for Prolog. The contin-\\nuation passing semantics of Nicholson and Foo [NF89] was used. Then instrumentations inside the\\noperational semantics were specified. Only 2 rules of one line each had to be instrumented in order\\nto get the “standard” trace of Prolog. The instrumentation itself is slightly tricky but it can be under-\\nstood without ambiguity when examining a formal specification of 10 lines. The detailed description\\nof this experiment is out of the scope of this article. Indeed, the explanations of operational semantics\\nrequires a couple of pages, understanding them requires a good knowledge of Prolog and this article\\nis not aiming at Prolog specialists.\\n\\n2.2 Specifying an abstract operational semantics\\n\\nAn operational semantics is not always available, for example we are not aware of any for the C lan-\\nguage. In such a case, starting the design of the tracer by designing a complete operational semantics\\nis certainly an overkill. An operational semantics specifies in detail the execution of a program. From\\nan operational semantics one can derive an implementation of a compiler. In order to design a tracer,\\nless information is usually needed than to implement a compiler. In that case, an abstract operational\\nsemantics is sufficient. The information given in an abstract operational semantics is correct but not\\ncomplete. It tells tracer developers what information should be provided to users and it tells users\\nhow to interpret this trace information. In the case of CLP(FD) there was no operational semantics\\nthat we could use to specify a tracer and we designed an abstract operational semantics as a set of\\nstate transition rules. .\\n\\n2.3 Informal presentation of domain reduction\\n\\nBefore we give examples of a formal specification of events we have to informally explain how vari-\\nable domains are reduced. This is an essential mechanism of constraint propagation in the case of\\nfinite domains. A CLP(FD) program searches a solution for a set of variables which take values\\nover finite domains and which must verify a set of constraints. The evolution of the domains can\\nbe viewed as a sequence of applications of reduction operators attached to the constraints. Each op-\\nerator can be applied several times until the computation reaches a fix-point [FLT00]. This fix-point\\nis the set of final domain states. An example of computation with reduction operators is shown in\\nFigure 1. There are three variables x, y and z and two constraints, x > y and y > z. A set of possi-\\nble values is associated to each variable. This set is called the domain of the variable. The domain\\nreduction consists in elementary steps that remove inconsistent values from those domains. At the\\nbeginning, the domain of x, Dx, the domain of y, Dy , and the domain of z, Dz , are all equal to {1, 2, 3}.\\nThis is represented by three columns of white squares. Considering the first constraint, it appears that\\nx cannot take the value “1”, because otherwise there would be no value for y such that x > y; ',\n",
       "                'this in-\\nconsistent value is withdrawn from Dx. This withdrawal is marked with a black square. In the same\\nway, the value 3 is withdrawn from the domain of y. Then, considering the constraint y > z, the sets\\n{1} and {2, 3} are respectively withdrawn from Dy and Dz . Finally, using again the first constraint to\\n\\nFifth Int.

The fix-point is reached.\\nThe final solution is {x = 3, y = 2, z = 1}.\\n\\n2.4 Samples of formal event rules for CLP(FD)\\n\\nOur abstract operational semantics is defined by a set of transition rules between observed states. An\\nobserved state is a tuple containing in particular: C, the set of constraints declared until this state;\\nV , the set of finite-domain variables declared until this state; D, the set of domains of the variables\\ndeclared until this state; A, the set of active constraints ; S, the set of sleeping constraints; and R,\\nthe set of rejected constraints which contains unsatisfiable constraints.\\n\\nFigure 2 gives six examples of transition rules specifying types of events of interest. The complete\\ntrace model contains thirteen event types. Rule newVariable specifies that a new variable x is intro-\\nduced in V and that its initial domain is Dx. Rule newConstraint specifies that the solver introduces\\na new constraint c in C, all variables involved in c are already defined. Rule reject specifies that if\\nthe active constraint (A = {c}) is unsatisfiable in the current state of the domains, it is put in the\\nset of rejected constraints, R. A constraint is unsatisfiable for example when one of its variables has\\nan empty domain. Rule suspend specifies that when an active constraint cannot reduce any domain\\nat the moment, it is suspended in S. Rule awake specifies that when the set of active constraints is\\nempty and some specific condition is fulfilled a suspended constraint can be awoken and become ac-\\ntive 3. Rule reduce specifies that if the active constraint, c, has a variable, x, with inconsistent values\\nin its domain, W c\\n\\nx(D), these values are withdrawn from its domain Dx.\\n\\nFifth Int.

This program, fd_element(I, [2,5,7],A), (A#=I ; A#=2), specifies that\\nA is a finite domain variable which is in {2, 5, 7} and I is the index of the value of A in this list;\\nmoreover A is either equal to I or equal to 2. The first option is infeasible; the trace shows the events\\nrelated to the failing attempt to satisfy it.\\n\\nThe trace can be read as follows. The first two events are related to the introduction of two vari-\\nables v1 and v2, corresponding respectively toI and A. In Gnu-Prolog variables are always created\\nwith the maximum domain (from 0 to 268.435.455). Then the first constraint is created: fd_element\\n(event #3). This constraint makes two domain reductions (events #4 and #5): the domain of the first\\nvariable (I) becomes {1, 2, 3} and the domain of A becomes {2, 5, 7}. After these reductions, the con-\\nstraint is suspended (event #6). The next constraint, A#=I, is added (event #7). Two reductions are\\ndone on variables A and I, the only possible value for A and I to be equal is 2 (events #8 and #9).\\nAfter these reductions, the constraint is suspended (event #10). The first constraint is awoken (event\\n#11). If A and I are both equal to 2, I cannot be the rank of A. Indeed, the rank of 2 is 1 and the value\\nat rank 2 is 5. The constraint is therefore rejected (event #12). The execution continues and find the\\nsolution A=2 and I=1. This requires 20 other events not shown here\\n\\n2.6 Discussion\\n\\nOur semantics does not specify how the rules are applied but what events are of interest and what\\ninformation is available at each event. ',\n",
       "                'As already mentioned, it helps tracer developers to design the\\ntracer and it helps tracer users to interpret the produced traces.\\n\\nFor example, rule reject tells the implementor that whenever the solver finds an unsatisfiable\\nconstraint, the tracer should be called with this constraint. The same rule tells users that when they\\nsee a reject event in a trace, the corresponding constraint has become unsatisfiable and there was\\npreviously no rejected constraint.\\n\\nSimilarly, rule reduce tells the implementor that, when the solver processes a reduction, the tracer\\nshould be called with information about the related constraint, the related variable and the new\\ndomain Dx. The same rule tells users that when they see a reduce event in a trace, the reduction\\nhas been achieved on one of the variables of the specified constraint, that there were inconsistent\\n\\n3Awakening conditions are solver dependent, and usually contain the “added value” of each solver.

In\\nmost tracers, users have to guess it. In our system, it is explicit, at least in the formal specification.\\n\\n3 Implementation of a prototype tracer\\n\\nA formal specification of trace model is helpful to formally reason about a trace. However, it actually\\nspecifies many traces for many kinds of solvers. It is sometime too arid to decide whether possible\\ntraces can be of any help to users. With that respect, it is better to have samples of execution traces\\nchecked by “guinea pig users”. Producing samples by hand is very tedious. It becomes quickly un-\\ntractable since the trace model evolves according to the remarks of the guinea pigs! New samples\\nhave therefore to be produced until a trace model is validated by users. It is, thus, welcome to have\\na tracer as quickly as possible. However, a low-level implementation is not suited before the trace\\nmodel has been validated by users. As already mentioned in the introduction, we propose to use a\\nprototype tracer in order to break this deadlock.\\n\\n3.1 Derivation of a prototype tracer from the CLP(FD) trace model\\n\\nIn our CLP(FD) experiment, we derive a CLP(FD) interpreter coded in Prolog that we instrument\\nwith trace hooks. Figure 4 contains the translation of reject and reduce rules of Figure 2. Each rule is\\nencoded by a predicate with the same name as the rule.\\n\\nBefore paraphrasing the code for one rule, we give the meaning of all the (simple) predicates\\nthat are used and not defined: get_varC(C, V) takes as input a constraint C and outputs a list\\nof the constraint variables that appear in C; member(X, L) is a standard Prolog predicate which\\nchecks whether X is an element of the list L; get_domain(X, D, Dx) takes a constraint vari-\\nable X and a domain state D, and outputs the domain of X (Dx); note that in Prolog = denotes a\\nunification; trace(Port, C, St0, Att1, Att2, Att3) takes as input the different event at-\\ntributes; it calls the trace analysis system which can, for example, print a trace line; reduction(C,\\nD, X, Wx) takes as input a constraint C, a domain state D, a constraint variable X, and outputs the\\n\\nFifth Int.

DUCASSÉ ET AL.\\n\\nvalues to withdraw from the domain of X; it fails if Wx = ∅ (no reduction can be done);\\nupdate_domain(X, Wx, D0, D, Mod) takes as input a constraint variable X, a value set Wx (to\\nwithdraw), and a domain state D0; it outputs the state domain D such that Dx=D0 - Wx, and the\\nlist of modification types Xmod1\\n\\n, ..., Xmodn\\n, where modi ∈ {min, max, ground, any, empty}. These\\n\\nmodifications characterize the Wx value withdrawal.\\nAll the predicates implementing transition rules take as input a solver state St0 and output a new\\n\\nsolver state St. St0 and St respectively denote the state of the solver before and after the application\\nof a rule. Predicate reject(St0, St) implements the reject rule. That rule needs to fulfill 3 condi-\\n',\n",
       "                'tions to be allowed to be applied: firstly, there is a constraint C in the active constraint set, secondly\\nthe set of rejected constraints is empty, and thirdly there exists a variable attached to the C constraint\\nwhose domain is empty. This last condition implies the unsatisfiable(c,D) predicate of Figure 2.\\nThe first two conditions are checked line 2. The third condition is checked lines 3 to 5 using Prolog\\nbacktracking. The execution of this predicate will backtrack to member(X, VarC) until either there\\nis no more variables in VarC or one of them has an empty domain. After the application of the rule\\nthe set of active constraints is empty and the set of rejected constraints contains C (line 6). The tracer\\nis called with the relevant information (line 7). Note the use of Prolog anonymous variables for ar-\\nguments 3 to 6. This means that the values are meaningless. The other rules are implemented in the\\nsame way.\\n\\nThe rules are integrated into the underlying Prolog system in the usual meta-interpretation way\\nof Prolog. This is not detailed in this article. An introduction to meta-interpreters in Prolog can be\\nfound in [SS94].\\n\\n3.2 Discussion\\n\\nWe have been able to systematically deduce the Prolog code from the specification. Even if the pro-\\nduction of the prototype tracer was not automatic, it has been sufficiently systematic so that the\\nmodifications of the trace model could be immediately integrated. Furthermore, it has always been\\neasy to convince ourselves that the produced prototypes indeed implemented the expected trace\\nmodel.\\n\\nThe produced prototype tracer was rather slow, but as already mentioned in the introduction,\\nefficiency is not an issue at this stage. The idea is to validate the trace model, the tracer designers use\\nthe prototype on well chosen and small programs.\\n\\nThe formal specification is very useful, but if time and resources are short, and if the prototype\\ntracer is very simple and easy to implement, it can be considered to start the design of the tracer with\\nthe prototype. One will miss the formal support for verification but at least there will be some means\\nto think about the trace design.\\n\\nIn our experiments, we have used the meta-interpretation capabilities of logic programming to\\nbuild prototype tracers. Even in languages with no meta-programming capabilities, there are always\\nsome means to easily produce prototypes. For example a source-level instrumentation of a subset\\nof the language is generally possible. Not all the features and libraries of a language need to be\\ninstrumented in the prototype. If the syntax of the language is specified by a grammar, then the in-\\nstrumentation can be implemented inside this grammar, for example with an attributed grammar\\nlanguage such as Yacc.\\n\\n4 Trace analysis\\n\\nOnce a first trace model is designed and a prototype tracer exists, it is important to play with actual\\ntraces.

Even toy programs can produce traces of thousands of events whose system-\\natic display would be inefficient and irrelevant. Therefore, we believe that the validation can be much\\nmore rigorous and powerful if it is automated. In our approach we connect the prototype tracer with\\nan automated trace analyzer à la Opium [Duc99b]. The first advantage is that many long traces can be\\nsystematically tested. A second advantage is that abstract and graphical views can be automatically\\nbuilt [Duc99a, Jah00]. In the case of CLP we have built a number of graphical views which helped\\nus select from the potential interesting trace information the ones that were really important and the\\nones that were not so crucial. It should be noted that, applying the methodology, the trace model that\\nwe designed varied quite a lot between the first design [LDDJ01] and the current one [LDD03].\\n\\nIn the remaining of this section we first present the generic trace querying facility. We then sketch\\none example of interesting graphical view of CLP(FD) executions which has been built with the trace\\nanalyzer.\\n\\n4.1 Analysis of the produced trace\\n\\n',\n",
       "                'In our trace analysis scheme, users can formulate queries in order to investigate an execution trace.\\nThe queries are formulated in the Prolog language extended by two primitives: fget/1 and\\nget_attr/2. fget/1 searches for a specific event forward in the execution trace, get_attr/2\\nretrieves data about the current event.\\n\\nEvents are searched for as the traced program is executed. There are two execution processes,\\none for the traced execution, and one for the trace analysis (called LSD in the following4). Figure 5\\nillustrates how the fget/1 primitive works. Let us assume that the programmer wants to query the\\nexecution trace of the program given in Figure 3. When the execution reaches the first event, it notifies\\nLSD which prompts the programmer for a trace query. The programmer enters a goal in order to\\n\\n4LSD stands for a “Long Story Debugger”.

At that moment, LSD can only get information about\\nthe current event. It therefore returns control to the traced execution. When the traced execution\\nreaches the next event, it locally checks whether the current chrono is equal to 4. As the current\\nchrono is not the requested one, the traced execution is resumed until the next event is reached.\\nThe chrono is again locally checked. Forward moves and checking are done in turn until the first\\nevent whose chrono is 4. LSD is notified and proceeds. The current event attributes are retrieved\\nby the print command which displays the related information. The execution of the trace query is\\ncompleted. The programmer is then prompted for another one.\\n\\nThe scheme previously described is a good compromise between efficiency and expressive power.\\nOn the one hand, the search for events is done in the traced process, and can be very efficient. On the\\nother hand, as the whole power of Prolog is available in the analyzer process, sophisticated debug-\\nging programs can be written.\\n\\nTwo examples of composed queries are given in Figure 6. The first query asks to go to the\\nfirst event whose port 5 is reduce with a chronological number (chrono) greater than 3. The re-\\nduced variable and the withdrawn domain are then retrieved and stored in the variables X and\\nWx On the trace given in Figure 3, the query would find the fourth event and return X=v1 and\\nWx=[0,4-268435455].\\n\\nThe second query of Figure 6 is an example of sophisticated query which could be integrated into\\nan analysis program. It counts the number of failures encountered before the first solution and prints\\nit. First, the counter is initialized (line 4). The fget primitive is used to find the next event whose\\nport is either reject or solution (line 5). Then the actual port is retrieved with get_attr (line 6). If it\\nis reject, then the counter is incremented (line 7) and a failure is forced (line 8). If it is not a reject, it\\nmeans that it is a solution; in that case the loop is stopped by simply executing true (line 9). In the\\ncase where the execution is made to fail, it will backtrack to the fget which will find the next event\\nwhose port is either reject or solution (line 5). If the execution does no longer contain such events,\\nthe overall query will simply fail. In the case where the loop terminates on a solution the value of the\\ncounter is retrieved (line 11) and printed (line 12).\\n\\n4.2 A CLP(FD) visualization of variable updates\\n\\nOne of our experiments is the generation of a 3D variable update view.

The details of reduce events allow us to assign\\ncolor to each kind of domain update (for example minimum or maximum value removed or domain\\nemptied) as made by Simonis and Aggoun in the Cosytec Search-Tree Visualizer [SA00]. The trace\\nanalysis is implemented in about 125 lines of Prolog and generates an intermediate file. A program\\n',\n",
       "                'implemented in 240 lines of C converts this file into the VRML format.\\n\\nFigure 7 shows the resolution of the 40-queens problem with two different enumeration strategies.\\nThere are three axes: variables, domain size and time. The first strategy is a first-fail selection of the\\nenumerated variable and the first value tried is the minimum of its domain. The second strategy is\\nalso a first-fail strategy but variable list is sorted with the middle variable first and the middle of\\ndomain is preferred to its minimum. The two graphical views allow users to compare the efficiency\\nof these two strategies by manipulating the 3D-model. With the first strategy, domain sizes on one\\nside of the chess-board quickly decrease, and the domain size on the other side oscillate at length.\\nWith the second strategy, domain sizes decrease more regularly and more symmetrically, the solution\\nis found faster. In fact, the second strategy, which consists in positioning the queens starting from the\\ncenter of the chess-board, benefits more from the symmetrical nature of the problem.\\n\\n4.3 Discussion\\n\\nThe list of all the variables attached to the problem is a relevant information because graphical views\\nsuch as the 3D-model display all the domains at a glance whereas the solver handles only a small\\nsubset of variables at a time. The above experiments made clear that the tracer must be able, if re-\\nquested, to provide the whole state at each event, namely the domains and the constraints of the\\nproblem. Furthermore, the list of variables involved in a given constraint is not straightforward to\\nget from the implementation. However, this kind of information is also crucial to build some graph-\\nical views which are helpful to users. Even if producing these types of information requires some\\nimplementation efforts and may have a cost in terms of performance, it is worth producing them.\\nThis was not possible to decide by just looking at the formal semantics.\\n\\n5 Efficient implementation\\n\\nWhen the trace designer knows what in the expected trace model is important for which debugging\\nfunctions. The actual implementation can start. The events of interest have to be located in the com-\\npiler or compiled code. It is also necessary to specify how to get the information related to each event.\\nAt this stage, the tracer implementors can decide that a piece of information is too tricky or too costly\\n\\nFifth Int.

This happens all the time in tracers produced without this methodology. The essential\\ndifference here is that the tracer implementors know what is kept or not and why. This is important\\nfor users. For example, if a particular graphical view requires some information which cannot be\\ngenerated in a particular implementation, users will know straightforwardly and will not discover it\\nthe hard way.\\n\\n5.1 The Gnu-Prolog tracer implementation\\n\\nEncoding a trace model that is not derived from the actual implementation of the solver is a delicate\\ntask. The correspondence between a formalized event and the code of the solver is not obvious: some\\nevents can be almost simultaneous, or a single event can be performed in several points of the code.\\nFor example, the trace model provides a unified view of the domain reduction with the reduce rule\\nwhereas there are several places to instrument in the code. Domain reduction is a crucial point in\\na constraint solver and the corresponding code is highly optimized. In Gnu-Prolog, there are four\\ndifferent cases for the domain reduction, depending on the way the values to withdraw have been\\ncomputed. The tracer handles each case with its peculiarities in order to get a single reduction event.\\nWhatever domain reduction routine is used, the trace event will be a reduce with standard attributes.\\n\\nAnother issue is the ability to proceed through the whole sets of constraints and variables, as well\\nas to allocate them unique identifiers. The solver only handles pointers on data structures. During\\nthe execution, a given pointer can be used for several constraints and variables. Moreover, at a given\\nmoment, the solver focuses on a small subset of entities. Therefore the tracer has to maintain its own\\ndata structures to reference all the pointers the solver handles. When the solver creates a new variable\\nor a new constraint, the tracer references the pointer on this new entity in a specific table. This table\\nassociates to this pointer a new integer identifier and some debugging data that can be useful in\\nthe sequel. When the solver deletes some constraints and variables, the corresponding entries are\\nremoved from the tracer table. This table can be used to search for an identifier knowing the pointer\\non an entity or to search for a pointer knowing the identifier of an entity. Both of these uses are made\\nin logarithmic time. ',\n",
       "                'Another possible use is retrieving the list of all the variables or the list of all the\\nconstraints.\\n\\nThe methodology has led to a trace model that is far from the implementation of Gnu-Prolog.\\nThe trace has needed the instrumentation of critical points in the solver. Nevertheless, the imple-\\nmentation has been possible and the final model has a clear semantics that is easy to understand\\nfor a constraint programmer. Moreover, the resulting tracer is efficient: the time overhead while ex-\\necuting a program without any trace output is between 5 and 30 percents (less than 10% in most of\\nour benchmarks). While producing a very detailed trace (with almost all the attributes the model\\nprovides), the time ratio against an untraced execution is between 3 and 7.4. These performances\\nare comparable to other debuggers known to be efficient enough, for example the Mercury tracer of\\nSomogyi and Henderson [SH99] or the ML tracer of Tolmach and Appel [TA95].\\n\\nIt is worth noticing that the tracer has been implemented in such a way that only the part of the\\ntrace which is required by a specific analysis is constructed: users pay only for what they need.\\n\\n5.2 Discussion\\n\\nTwo other tracers exist for constraint programming. The first one is the trace mechanism of the Ilog\\nSolver platform. Ilog Solver is a C++ library for constraint solving. Some virtual trace functions are\\ncalled at some specific points of the solver. By default, those functions do nothing. The developer can\\nredefine them to produce his own trace. The parameters of the trace functions are the attributes of\\nthe corresponding trace events. Taking the critical example of domain reduction, we see that trace\\nevents are guided by the implementation: there are two events by special case Ilog Solver handles:\\nan event before and an event after. Their attributes depend on the case that is active. At the opposite,\\nour model and implementation provide a single unified event with all the data at a glance.\\n\\nFifth Int.

Its trace model is dedicated\\nto Sicstus implementation. The tracer is based on a complete storage of the trace and postmortem\\ninvestigation. When a specific data on an event is asked for, the tracer has to traverse the trace back-\\nwards until the data is found or is able to be recomputed. Most of our trace model could be produced\\nthis way but it is not realistic for real-life executions.\\n\\n6 Validation\\n\\nAnother important problem when building a tracer is to validate the result. In particular, it is impor-\\ntant to be sure that the produced trace is indeed the expected one. As opposed to the prototype, the\\nefficient implementation has no obvious relation to the formal specification.\\n\\nOur methodology proposes to further take benefits of the prototype implementation in order to\\ncompare the traces produced by the actual tracer with the trace produced by the prototype. This\\ncomparison is not expected to be a bijection in the general case. Indeed, some events may not be\\nimplemented (see the discussion above), some information may not be available. In addition, the\\nactual tracer may also produce larger traces for example for the parts of the language and libraries\\nthat were not taken into account in the prototype. As a consequence, at present, the comparison\\nbetween the two types of traces has to be done by hand.\\n\\n6.1 Validation of the Gnu-Prolog tracer implementation\\n\\nFor our experiment we compared the traces of the executions of some small programs produced\\nby the prototype tracer and the Gnu-prolog tracer. Figure 8 shows portions of trace related to the\\nintroduction of a new variable. In the prototype tracer, the variables are directly introduced with\\ntheir specified domain. In the Gnu-Prolog solver, every time a new variable is introduced, its domain\\ninitially contains all the possible values and the following execution steps use the regular reduction\\nmechanism to reduce the domain to the one which was declared. In our example, the two events of\\nlines 1 and 2 produced by the prototype tracer correspond to the events of lines 3 to 8 produced by the\\nGnu-Prolog tracer. These events appear in Figure 3 and have already been explained in section 2.5.\\n\\n6.2 Discussion\\n\\nBesides the identification of some minor implementation problems, this analysis led us to refine the\\n',\n",

The need for this refinement could probably have been detected\\nby other means, the systematic comparison of the two types of traces, however, was a good support\\nto find problems in the low-level implementation, and this quite early in the life time of the software.\\n\\n7 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article we have presented a methodology to rigorously design and implement tracers in 5\\nsteps: 1) design a formal specification of the trace model, 2) derive a prototype tracer, 3) analyze the\\nproduced traces, 4) implement an efficient tracer, 5) compare the traces produced by the efficient\\nimplementation and the prototype.\\n\\nThe methodology has been used within the context of logic programming where there is a strong\\nbackground on semantics. We, however, believe that the state transition approach can be applied to\\nspecify formal trace models for other programming paradigms.\\n\\nEven if we advocate to follow the complete methodology, some of the steps can be useful with-\\nout the others. For example, even without a formal specification, starting with an easy to build and\\nunderstand prototype tracer is already a major improvement over starting directly by the implemen-\\ntation of a low-level tracer.\\n\\nWe have shown how this methodology has been used to design and implement a real tracer\\nfor CLP(FD) which is able to efficiently generate information required to build interesting graphical\\nviews of executions. The trace model has been designed following mainly user’s concerns whereas\\nusual tracers are designed following mainly implementation concerns. The resulting tracer has per-\\nformances comparable to efficient tracers, therefore the methodology improves the quality of the\\nproduced trace, and does not prevent efficiency.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank Rachid Zoumman who implemented the C code which generates\\nthe VRML used in some analyses.

Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.'],\n",

A well-known limitation of dependence\\nanalysis is that it examines only the memory locations\\nread and written by a statement, and does not assume\\nany particular interpretation for the operations in that\\nstatement. Exploiting the semantics of these operations\\nenables a wider set of transformations to be used, and is\\ncritical for optimizing important codes such as LU fac-\\ntorization with pivoting.\\n\\nSymbolic execution of programs enables the ex-\\nploitation of such semantic properties, but it is in-\\ntractable for all but the simplest programs. In this paper,\\nwe propose a new form of symbolic analysis for use in\\nrestructuring compilers. Fractal symbolic analysis com-\\npares a program and its transformed version by repeat-\\nedly simplifying these programs until symbolic analysis\\nbecomes tractable, ensuring that equality of simplified\\nprograms is sufficient to guarantee equality of the origi-\\nnal programs. We present a prototype implementation of\\nfractal symbolic analysis, and show how it can be used\\nto optimize the cache performance of LU factorization\\nwith pivoting.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nModern compilers perform source-level transformations\\nof programs to enhance locality and parallelism. Be-\\nfore such transformations can be performed, the source\\nprogram must be analyzed to ensure that the proposed\\ntransformation does not violate the semantics of the pro-\\ngram. The most commonly used analysis technique is\\ndependence analysis. The goal of this technique is to\\ncompute a partial order between the statements of the\\nprogram such that any statement reordering consistent\\nwith this partial order is guaranteed to leave the output\\n\\n0This work was supported by NSF grants CCR-9720211, EIA-\\n9726388 and ACI-9870687.\\n\\nS1: a = 2*a; a = a+b;\\nS2: b = 2*b; => b = 2*b;\\nS3: a = a+b; a = 2*a;\\n(a) Original program (b) Transformed program\\n\\nFigure 1: Simple Reordering of Statements\\n\\nof the program unchanged. In general, three kinds of de-\\npendences may exist from a statement S1 to a statement\\nS2 executed after it.\\n\\n1. Flow-dependence: A flow-dependence exists from\\nS1 to S2 if S1 may write to a memory location read\\nby S2.\\n\\n2. Anti-dependence: An anti-dependence exists from\\nS1 to S2 if S1 may read from a memory location\\nwritten by S2.\\n\\n3. Output-dependence: An output-dependence exists\\nfrom S1 to S2 if S1 may write to a memory location\\nwritten by S2.\\n\\nAlthough dependence analysis is very powerful, it\\nhas its shortcomings, as shown by the simple program in\\nFigure 1(a). In this program, there is a flow-dependence\\nfrom statement S1 to S3 and from S2 to S3, and there\\nis an anti-dependence and output-dependence from S1\\nto S3. There are only two statement reorderings consis-\\ntent with this partial order: the original program, and the\\nprogram obtained by reordering S2 and S1. In particu-\\nlar, the statement order shown in Figure 1(b) is not con-\\nsistent with this partial order, so a compiler that relies\\non dependence analysis will declare that this transfor-\\nmation is not legal since it may not respect the seman-\\ntics of the original program. It is not difficult however\\nto verify by symbolic execution that the two programs\\nin Figure 1 are equivalent (assuming the usual algebraic\\nlaws for numbers). If ����� and\\n\\n� ��� are the values of a\\nand b at the start of either program, the final value in a\\nis �\\t��\\n �����\\r� � ����� and the final value in b is �\\r� � ��� in both\\nprograms. Intuitively, the constraints imposed on trans-\\nformations by dependence analysis are sufficient but not\\nstrictly necessary to guarantee that transformations do\\nnot change the meaning of the program.\\n\\n\\n\\nA more precise variation of dependence analysis is\\nvalue-based dependence analysis [8, 17, 19]. While\\nstandard, or memory-based dependence analysis con-\\nsiders statements that touch the same memory location,\\nvalue-based dependence analysis also requires that there\\nare no intervening writes so that the statements touch the\\nsame value. Even though value-based dependence anal-\\nysis is less restrictive than memory-based dependence\\nanalysis, it is still too conservative for our purposes. It\\nis easy to verify that all dependencies in the example in\\nFigure 1 are also value dependencies.\\n\\nAlthough the program in Figure 1 is contrived, it\\nillustrates an inadequacy of dependence analysis that\\nshows up when dependence analysis is used to restruc-\\nture more realistic codes like LU with pivoting. Intu-\\nitively, dependence analysis considers only the sets of\\nlocations read and written by statements; it does not\\nassume any particular interpretation (meaning) for the\\noperations in each statement. As our simple example\\nshows, exploiting the semantics of these operations can\\n',\n",
       "                'lead to a richer space of program transformations.\\n\\nSymbolic analysis is the usual way of exploiting se-\\nmantics. To compare two programs for equality, we\\nderive expressions for the outputs of these programs as\\nfunctions of inputs, and attempt to prove that these ex-\\npressions are equal. In principle, symbolic analysis is\\nextremely powerful; not only does it subsume depen-\\ndence analysis but it can also be used to prove equal-\\nity of programs that implement very different algorithms\\nsuch as sorting programs that implement quicksort and\\nmergesort. However, for all but the simplest programs,\\nsymbolic execution and comparison is intractable. A\\nlimited kind of symbolic analysis called value number-\\ning [1] and a generalization called global value num-\\nbering [21] are used in optimizing compilers to iden-\\ntify opportunities for common subexpression elimina-\\ntion and constant propagation, but these techniques are\\nnot useful for comparing different programs. Faced with\\nthis intractability, compiler-writers have settled for sim-\\nple pattern-matching to identify computations in which\\nsemantic information can be exploited for restructuring.\\nFor example, all modern restructuring compilers attempt\\nto recognize reductions which are statements in which a\\ncommutative and associative operation like addition is\\napplied to the elements of an array [24]. Unfortunately,\\npattern matching techniques are fragile since they are\\neasily confused by small changes to the pattern such as\\nperforming a reduction to an array location rather than\\nto a scalar variable. Sophisticated symbolic analysis\\ntechniques for finding generalized induction variables\\nhave been developed by Haghighat and Polychronopou-\\nlos [11] and by Rauchwerger and Padua [20], but these\\ntechniques do not apply to the programs that we discuss.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a novel way of perform-\\ning symbolic analysis of programs that we call fractal\\nsymbolic analysis. It is based on three ideas.\\n\\n1. If the programs to be compared are too complicated\\nfor symbolic comparison, fractal symbolic analysis\\nsimplifies these programs in a way that ensures that\\nequality of the simplified programs conversatively\\nimplies equality of the original programs.\\n\\n2. In general, it is not clear how such a simplification\\nmay be accomplished, but for codes obtained by\\ncommon program transformations, the appropriate\\nsimplification may be derived from the transforma-\\ntion.\\n\\n3. This simplification process may be applied recur-\\nsively until tractable programs are obtained, which\\nis why we call this approach fractal symbolic anal-\\nysis.\\n\\nOur approach to simplification in this paper is in-\\nspired by Rinard and Diniz [22]. Their approach, called\\ncommutativity analysis, is based on the insight that a se-\\nquence of atomic operations could be executed in any\\npermuted order (e.g., in parallel in their case) if each\\npair of operations can be shown to commute. While\\ntheir analysis is not applicable to the program transfor-\\nmations we consider, we employ a more powerful vari-\\nation of this idea in fractal symbolic analysis.\\n\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In\\nSection 2, we introduce the highlights of our technol-\\nogy by discussing a small program that is a distillation\\nof LU factorization with pivoting. We then describe\\nour prototype implementation. In Section 3, we dis-\\ncuss the simplification process and derive the rules for\\ndifferent transformations in the literature. In Section 4,\\nwe demonstrate how we perform symbolic analysis once\\nthe programs to be compared are “simple enough”. We\\napply this technology to automatic blocking of LU fac-\\ntorization with pivoting in Section 5 and show that we\\nachieve performance comparable with that of the LA-\\nPACK library [2] on the SGI Octane. Finally, in Sec-\\ntion 6, we discuss ongoing work.\\n\\n2 A simple example\\n\\nFigure 2(a) shows an imperfectly-nested loop nest that\\nwrites to an array A of size N. A read-only array p,\\nwhose role is similar to that of the pivot array in LU fac-\\ntorization, is assumed to contain integers between 1 and\\nN such that p(j) � j. This information about array p\\nmust be provided by the programmer; in the actual LU\\ncode, it is easily deduced by the compiler, as we show\\nin Section 5. In iteration j of the outer loop, the values\\nin A(j) and A(p(j)) are swapped, and each element\\n\\n\\n\\ndo j = 1,N //swap\\nS1: //swap do j = 1,N\\n\\ntmp = A(j); tmp = A(j);\\nA(j) = A(p(j)); A(j) = A(p(j));\\nA(p(j)) = tmp; A(p(j)) = tmp;\\n\\nS2: //update //update\\ndo i = j+1,N do j = 1,N\\n\\nA(i) = A(i)/A(j) do i = j+1,N\\nA(i) = A(i)/A(j);\\n\\n(a) Original Program (b) Transformed Program\\n\\n.......... ..........\\n\\n.......... ..........\\n\\n?\\n\\nS1(1) S1(l)\\n\\nS2(m)\\n\\nS1(N)\\n\\nS2(N)S2(1)\\n\\nS1\\n\\nS2\\n\\n(c) Legality Check for Loop Distribution\\n\\nFigure 2: Loop distribution in a simple program\\n\\nA(i) in the sub-array A(j+1..N) is replaced by some\\nfunction of A(i) and A(j) (e.g., A(i)/A(j) in our\\ncase).\\n\\nIt is convenient to refer collectively to the three state-\\n',\n",
       "                'ments for the swap as S1, and to the update loop as S2.\\nEach dot in Figure 2(c) represents the execution of ei-\\nther S1 or S2 for some iteration of the j loop. We will\\nlet S2(m) denote the execution of statement S2 in iter-\\nation m of the outer loop. Similarly, S1(l) denotes the\\ninstance of S1 for which the j loop index is l.\\n\\nFigure 2(b) shows the result of distributing the j\\nloop over statements S1 and S2. In the transformed\\nprogram, all swaps are done before any of the updates.\\nSince loop distribution changes the order in which oper-\\nations are performed, it is not always legal. In this case,\\nit can be seen that both programs compute the same ar-\\nray A provided p(j) � j.\\n\\nHow can a compiler reach this conclusion?\\n\\n2.1 Dependence Analysis\\n\\nAs described in Section 1, dependence analysis com-\\nputes a partial order between statements (in loop pro-\\ngrams, between statement instances) by determining\\nflow-, anti- and output-dependences. In the program of\\nFigure 2(a), S2(1) reads and writes to location A(2)\\nwhich is later read and written by S1(2). There-\\nfore, there is a flow-dependence, an anti-dependence\\nand an output-dependence from S2(1) to S1(2). In\\nthe transformed program, the order of execution of these\\ntwo instances is reversed. Violating dependence order\\nmay change the answers produced by the program, so\\na compiler that uses dependence analysis will conclude\\nconservatively that loop distribution is not legal.\\n\\n2.2 Symbolic analysis\\n\\nThe most straight-forward kind of symbolic analysis\\nperforms symbolic execution of the program to com-\\npute expressions representing the values in array A at\\nthe end of execution of the original and transformed pro-\\ngrams, and attempts to prove that these expressions are\\nthe same in both programs. This approach is relatively\\nstraightforward for basic blocks such as the programs in\\nFigure 1, but it is not tractable for more complex pro-\\ngrams with loops, conditionals and arrays such as the\\nprograms in Figure 2. For example, what does it mean\\nto execute a loop when the loop bounds are symbolic\\nexpressions? We do not know any tractable way of per-\\nforming symbolic evaluation and comparison even for\\nthe simple program in Figure 2, let alone LU factoriza-\\ntion!\\n\\nA more subtle symbolic analysis strategy is to use\\nproof techniques like computational induction [10] to\\nprove program equality. This approach is used widely\\nin proving the correspondence of denotational and op-\\nerational semantics of programs for example, but it is\\nnot clear how to use this approach for our problem. The\\nintermediate values in array A are quite different in the\\ntwo programs, and it is only at the end of execution that\\nthe values in array A in the two programs are identical,\\nso it is difficult to think of a predicate which can be\\nproved correct using inductive reasoning on the num-\\nber of computational steps. Even if such a predicate can\\nbe designed, it is unclear how a compiler could invent it\\nduring restructuring.\\n\\n2.3 Fractal Symbolic Analysis\\n\\nThese difficulties led us to a new approach to program\\nanalysis that we call fractal symbolic analysis. If com-\\nparing two programs symbolically is too complicated,\\nwe simplify these programs but ensure that equality of\\nthe simplified programs implies equality of the origi-\\nnal programs. Intuitively, traditional symbolic analy-\\nsis attempts to prove a predicate that is both necessary\\nand sufficient to prove program equality, and gives up\\nwhen the programs are too complex; in contrast, frac-\\ntal symbolic analysis handles complexity by attempting\\nto prove stronger predicates that are sufficient (but not\\nalways necessary) for program equality.\\n\\n2.3.1 Simplifying Programs\\n\\nIt is not clear how to carry out this simplification in gen-\\neral, but in the context of this paper, we are interested\\nonly in comparing a program before and after some\\ntransformation. This suggest that we exploit the trans-\\nformation to derive the simplified programs. To under-\\n\\n\\n\\nS1(l): //swap S2(m)://update\\ntmp = A(l); do i = m+1,N\\nA(l) = A(p(l)); A(i) = A(i)/A(m)\\nA(p(l)) = tmp; S1(l)://swap\\n\\nS2(m): //update temp = A(l)\\ndo i = m+1,N A(l) = A(p(l));\\n\\nA(i) = A(i)/A(m) A(p(l)) = tmp;\\n\\n(a) S1(l) before S2(m) (b) S2(m) before S1(l)\\n\\n.......... ..........S1\\n\\nS2\\nS2(m) S2(N)S2(1)\\n\\n.......... ..........\\n\\nS1(l) S1(N)S1(1)\\n\\n(c) Partial loop distribution\\n\\nFigure 3: Two orders of executing statement instances\\n\\nstand this, consider the running example of Figure 2.\\nImagine that loop distribution is accomplished not in a\\nsingle step but incrementally by dragging instances of\\nS1 in Figure 2(c) to the left over instances of S2. When\\nall instances of S1 are scheduled before all instances\\nof S2, we have accomplished loop distribution. At any\\npoint during this process, consider an instance S1(l)\\nthat is executed immediately after an instance of S2(m)\\n(so l � m). Suppose we can show that S1(l) can be\\nscheduled immediately before S2(m) without changing\\nthe result of the program. If so, we can advance the pro-\\n',\n",

Therefore, if, for all ������������� , S2(m) and\\nS1(l) can be executed in either order (they commute),\\nloop distribution is legal. The two simplified programs\\nwe have to compare are shown in Figure 3.\\n\\n2.3.2 Symbolic Comparison of Simplified Pro-\\ngrams\\n\\nOur core symbolic comparison engine, described in\\nmore detail in Section 4, can analyze these simpli-\\nfied programs directly since they involve only statement\\ncomposition and loops with no recurrences.

We conclude that S1(l) and\\nS2(m) commute; therefore, the two programs in Fig-\\nure 2 are themselves equal.\\n\\nNote that in other programs, such as the programs in\\nFigure 1, we may need to exploit algebraic laws to prove\\nequality of guarded symbolic expressions. Therefore,\\nthe core symbolic comparison engine should itself be\\nable to invoke a symbolic algebra tool like Maple [5].\\n\\n2.3.3 Recursive Simplification\\n\\nIn general, the simplified programs that result by apply-\\ning these rules may themselves be too complicated to\\n\\n\\n\\nS1(l): //swap S2(m,i)://update body\\ntmp = A(l); A(i) = A(i)/A(m);\\nA(l) = A(p(l)); S1(l)://swap\\nA(p(l)) = tmp; temp = A(l);\\n\\nS2(m,i): //update body A(l) = A(p(l));\\nA(i) = A(i)/A(m); A(p(l)) = tmp;\\n\\nFigure 4: Recursive Simplification for the Running Ex-\\nample\\n\\nbe evaluated symbolically. If so, it may be necessary to\\napply these rules to the simplified programs recursively.\\nThis is the case for LU factorization with pivoting, as\\nwe show in Section 5. It is instructive to consider a re-\\ncursive simplification of the programs in Figure 3 that\\neliminates the update loop. We can reorder S1(l) and\\nS2(m) incrementally by dragging instances of the up-\\ndate loop S2(m,i) over S1(l). The legality of each\\nof these incremental steps can be determined by check-\\ning if the programs in Figure 4 produce the same output\\nfor all i,m,l such that �:�n�O��o/pm�q�n� .\\n\\nThe two programs in Figure 4 are delightfully simple\\nsince they are just straight-line programs, but it is easy\\nto show that they are not equal; for example, for rEsut :� � \\nFt � s�� ��� \\n�va\\nFt �m�Fw ��\\n�x � but �  \\nFt � sy� ��� \\nWv&\\n$t �I� . Had\\nwe carried out the simplification of the programs in Fig-\\nure 2 to this level, we would have concluded conserva-\\ntively that the program transformation in Figure 2 is not\\nlegal.\\n\\nThis discussion highlights an important aspect of\\nfractal symbolic analysis: successive applications of\\nsimplification produce successively stronger predicates\\nwhich are less likely to be true. Therefore, the core sym-\\nbolic comparison engine should be as powerful as pos-\\nsible so that simplification can be applied sparingly.\\n\\n3 Fractal Symbolic Analysis\\n\\nA fractal symbolic analyzer for checking legality of\\ntransformations has two components: (i) a core sym-\\nbolic comparison engine for comparing programs that\\nare “simple enough”, and (ii) simplification rules for\\nsimplifying programs that are not simple enough.\\n\\n',\n",
       "                'To prove that a program transformation is valid, the\\ncompiler first attempts symbolic comparison (described\\nin the next section).

We discuss an implemen-\\ntation of this function in Section 4. The boolean function\\nSimple checks whether a statement is simple enough for\\nCompare. If both statements are simple, the comparison\\nengine is invoked; otherwise, the recursive simplifica-\\ntion rules shown in Figure 7 are used to simplify the\\nstatements further. These rules are based on the syntac-\\ntic structure of the two programs to be compared.\\n\\nAs mentioned in Section 2, the precision of frac-\\ntal symbolic analysis depends on the power of the core\\nsymbolic comparison engine. Notice that the procedure\\nin Figure 5 stops simplifying as soon as the statements\\nbeing compared can be handled by the Compare proce-\\ndure. A more powerful Compare procedure will result in\\nfewer levels of simplification and potentially more ac-\\ncurate symbolic analysis.\\n\\n4 Symbolic Comparison\\n\\nWe now describe the core symbolic comparison proce-\\ndure that is invoked after simplification. As mentioned\\nearlier, it is important for this procedure to be as pow-\\nerful as is tractable so that simplification can be applied\\nsparingly. In our work, we have found that it is suffi-\\ncient if the symbolic comparison procedure can handle\\nthe following class of programs.Ô Programs consist of assignment statements, for-\\n\\nloops and conditionals.

Al-\\nthough a loop may write to a section of an array that\\nis potentially unbounded at compile-time, at most one\\niteration may effect the value of any given location in an\\narray. This ensures that the symbolic value of a given el-\\nement of the array can be expressed finitely. Techniques\\nsuch as scalar expansion [24] should be used to aggres-\\nsively eliminate loop-carried dependences.\\n\\nWe can then summarize the unbounded set of expres-\\nsions for the values in an entire array with a finite ex-\\npression called a guarded symbolic expression (or GSE\\nfor short) which contains symbolic expressions that hold\\nfor affinely constrained portions of the array as shown\\nin Figure 8. Section 2 contains a number of examples of\\nguarded symbolic expressions.\\n\\nFigure 9 provides a high-level overview of our sym-\\nbolic comparison algorithm. We consider each altered\\nscalar or array variable in the two programs being com-\\npared. Note that we only need to consider live vari-\\nables [1].

There are two steps to\\nthis comparison. First, we must compare each pair of\\naffine guards of the two guarded symbolic expressions.\\nSecond, for any two guards that potentially intersect,\\nwe must compare the corresponding symbolic expres-\\nsions. If all such symbolic expression match, then the\\nguarded symbolic expressions are declared to be equal.\\nThe validity of this conclusion follows from the follow-\\ning argument. Each guard specifies some region of the\\nindex space of the array in question, and the union of\\nthese regions in a guarded symbolic expression is equal\\nto the entire index space of that array. If the values in the\\ntwo guarded symbolic expressions are identical when-\\never their guards intersect, the two array values are ob-\\nviously equal.\\n\\nFor comparison of affine guards, we may employ\\nan integer programming tool such as the Omega Li-\\nbrary [18], which we have chosen for our implemen-\\ntation. If our tool can automatically verify that a pair of\\naffine guards do not intersect, there is no need for further\\ncomparison.\\n\\nFor comparison of symbolic expressions, we cur-\\nrently test for syntactic equality. This is sufficient both\\nfor our simple example and, as we shall see in Section 5,\\nfor LU factorization.

LU factoriza-\\ntion with partial pivoting is a key routine in this appli-\\ncation area since it is used to solve systems of linear\\nequations of the form Ax = b. Figure 14 shows the\\ncanonical right-looking version of LU factorization with\\npivoting that appears in the literature [9]. In iteration j\\nof the outer loop, computations are performed on col-\\numn j of the matrix A, and a portion of the matrix to\\n\\n\\n\\nthe right of this column is updated. The i and k loops\\nin the update step can be interchanged, giving two ver-\\nsions of right-looking LU factorization. A rather differ-\\nent version of LU factorization is called left-looking LU\\nfactorization; intuitively, this version delays the updates\\nmade by the right-looking version to a column till it is\\ntime to compute with that column.\\n\\nCache-optimized versions of LU factorization can\\nbe found in the LAPACK library [2]. These blocked\\ncodes are too complex to be reproduced here, but they\\nperform much better than the point version shown in\\nFigure 14. Figure 19 shows the performance of the\\npoint version and two blocked versions on an SGI Oc-\\ntane1. One blocked version was obtained from the\\nNetlib repository2, and it is a portable blocked LU that\\ncalls BLAS [9] routines tuned for the Octane to per-\\nform key operations like matrix multiplication. The sec-\\nond blocked version was written at SGI for the Octane.\\nFigure 19 shows that the performance of the point ver-\\nsion degrades to about 70 MFlops for large matrix sizes;\\nin contrast, the Netlib blocked code obtains about 425\\nMFlops, while the SGI blocked code obtains about 475\\nMFlops.\\n\\nLU factorization with pivoting poses a number of\\nchallenges for compiler writers.\\n\\n1. Given point-wise LU factorization with pivoting,\\ncan a compiler automatically generate a cache-\\noptimized version by blocking the code? If so, how\\ndoes the performance of the compiler-optimized\\ncode compare with that of hand-blocked code?\\n\\n2. Modern restructuring compilers can transform one\\nversion of right-looking LU factorization to the\\nother automatically by interchanging the two loops\\nof the update step. Can a compiler transform right-\\nlooking LU to left-looking LU and vice versa?\\n\\nFractal symbolic analysis is crucial to address both\\nthese challenges.

The\\ncompiler invokes the Commute method in Figure 5 with\\nthese parameters. However, these simpler programs are\\nnot “simple enough”; the loop that computes the pivot\\nin B1.b(l) is a recurrence that cannot be handled by\\nour core symbolic comparison engine, as we discussed\\nin Section 4. Therefore, these programs are simplified\\nagain using the rule for statement sequences in Figure 7.\\nThis requires the compiler to test whether B2(m) com-\\nmutes with the five subblocks in B1(l). With the ex-\\nception of B1.c(l), the data touched by each of the\\nsubblocks of B1(l) is disjoint from the data touched by\\nB2(m). Therefore, the compiler deduces that these sub-\\nblocks commute with B2(m) (a small detail is that the\\nanalysis of whether B1.b(l) commutes with B2(m)\\nrequires an additional step of simplification to eliminate\\nthe recurrence in B1.b(l)).\\n\\nThe difficult part of this process is to demonstrate\\nthat B1.c(l) and B2(m) commute as shown in Fig-\\nure 18. At this point, these programs are “simple\\nenough”, and the Compare method in Figure 9 is invoked\\nto establish equality of the simplified programs. In fact,\\nthey are quite similar to those in our simple example and\\nguarded expressions are generated in the same fashion\\n\\nas discussed in Section 4. The only live, altered variable\\nin either program is the array A, and the Compare method\\ngenerates guarded symbolic expressions for A from each\\nprogram. Both GSE’s generated from Figure 18 contain\\nsix guarded regions, correlating directly to the picture in\\nFigure 15. To prove that the GSE’s are actually equiv-\\nalent, Compare GSEs is invoked to test the 36 pairwise\\nintersections, and the Omega library [18] is used to test\\nthe satisfiability. Only six intersections are non-empty,\\nand the corresponding symbolic expressions are syntac-\\ntically identical in each case. Thus, the compiler is able\\nto demonstrate the equality of the simplified programs\\nand, therefore, the programs in Figure 16.\\n\\nNote that the programs are only equivalent given thatv&\\nW¬ � �c¬ . Techniques such as value propagation [16, 7]\\nhave been developed to perform this type of analysis for\\nindirect array accesses to more accurately compute de-\\npendences.

We are pursuing several\\nstrategies to improve the analysis time.\\n\\n5.2 Experimental Results\\n\\nTo study the effects of automatic blocking, we ran the\\nSGI compiler on the LU code in Figure 16, after loop\\ndistribution is performed. Given just this slightly trans-\\nformed code, the SGI compiler is now able to produce\\nsignificantly faster code that does not degrade as ma-\\ntrices exceed the cache. Once the loop is distributed,\\nthe compiler is able to automatically tile the right-\\nlooking update (B2) and essentially accomplish the last\\nCarr/Lehoucq step listed above.\\n\\nNevertheless, this code, at 200 MFlops, is still a fac-\\ntor of two slower than the LAPACK codes. Further ex-\\nperimentation found the remaining performance gap due\\nthe compiler’s suboptimal treatment of the right-looking\\nupdate computation. Although, the SGI compiler is able\\n\\nto now block the update, we surmise that it may have\\nbeen confused by the partially triangular loop bounds of\\nthe update. When we index-set split the i loop by hand\\nto separate the triangular and rectangular portions of the\\nupdate, the compiler generated substantially faster code\\nachieving over 300 MFlops. Finally, we note that if we\\nreplace the triangular and rectangular portions of the up-\\ndate with the corresponding BLAS-3 calls (DTRSM and\\nDGEMM) used in LAPACK, the resulting code achieves\\nnearly 400 MFlops and is within 10% of Netlib LA-\\nPACK and 20% of the best hand-optimized code. Thus,\\nwith the ability to isolate the update, we believe that\\ncompilers should be able to nearly match the LAPACK\\nas their ability to match the performance of BLAS on\\nperfectly nested codes improves.\\n\\n6 Conclusions and Future Work\\n\\nIn this paper, we presented a new analysis technique\\ncalled fractal symbolic analysis for proving the validity\\nof program transformations.\\n\\nWe are currently exploring different options in the\\ndesign of the fractal symbolic analyzer.

A symbolic algebra tool like Maple [5] will\\nadd to the power of the comparison engine, and this\\npower will be useful once we recognize and summa-\\nrize reductions. These enhancements might eliminate\\nthe need for recursive simplification in some programs,\\nbut we do not yet have any applications where this addi-\\ntional power is needed.\\n\\nThe algorithm for generating guarded symbolic ex-\\npressions in Section 2.3.2 is reminiscent of backward\\nslicing [23] which is a technique that isolates the por-\\ntion of a program that may affect the value of a variable\\nat some point in the program. Our algorithm is simpler\\nthan the usual algorithms for backward slicing since the\\nprograms it must deal with have been simplified before-\\nhand by recursive simplification, an operation that has\\nno analog in backward slicing. A similar statement can\\nbe made about the computation of last-write informa-\\ntion [6].\\n\\nFinally, we note that dependence information for\\nloops can be represented abstractly using dependence\\nvectors, cones, polyhedra etc. These representations\\nhave been exploited to synthesize transformation se-\\nquences [3, 13, 15]. At present, we do not know suitable\\nrepresentations for the results of fractal symbolic anal-\\nysis, nor do we know how to synthesize transformation\\nsequences from such information.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] A.

Pregnant cows were vaccinated intramuscularly and intramammarily with recombinant baculovirus-expressed SA11 rotavirus VLP (triple-layered virus-like particles containing rotavirus VP2, VP4, VP6 and VP7); CLP (double-layered core-like particles containing rotavirus VP2 and VP6); or inactivated SA11 rotavirus, respectively. Rotavirus antigen titers were highest (30–200-fold) in ELISA in the VLP vaccine compared to the inactivated SA11 vaccine. The IgG1, IgG2 and IgM geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) to rotavirus (titers to bovine rotavirus vs SA11 rotavirus did not differ significantly for any isotype or group) and the IgG2 GMT to VP6 in serum at calving in the vaccinated groups were significantly (P <0.05) higher than in the control group. In colostrum, IgG1 and IgA rotavirus antibody titers were significantly elevated for VLP (IgG1 GMT 832225; IgA GMT 16384), CLP (IgG1 GMT 660561; IgA GMT 10321) and SA11 (IgG1 GMT 131072; IgA GMT 1448) vaccinated cows compared to control cows (IgG1 GMT 11585; IgA GMT 45). The IgG1 and IgA GMT to rotavirus were significantly elevated (6–100-fold) in milk of VLP and CLP vaccinated cows compared to SA11 vaccinated or control cows. The isotype antibody responses to VP6 in serum, colostrum and milk paralleled the responses to rotavirus, but titers were ∼2–10-fold lower. Only cows vaccinated with VLP had significantly enhanced serum, colostral and milk antibody titers to rotavirus VP4 and VP7. These results demonstrate that rotavirus antibody titers in serum, colostrum and milk are significantly enhanced by use of non-infectious VLP, CLP and inactivated SA11 rotavirus vaccines, but the VLP or CLP vaccines induced the highest antibody responses, corresponding to their higher rotavirus antigen titers measured by ELISA.'],\n",

In humans, defects in expression of this enzyme lead to a fatal neurodegenerative disease, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Similar enzymes have been found in the genomic sequences of several species, but neither systematic analyses of their distribution nor modeling of their structures have been previously attempted. RESULTS: We have analyzed the presence of orthologs of human CLN2 in the genomic sequences of a number of eukaryotic species. Enzymes with sequences sharing over 80% identity have been found in the genomes of macaque, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. Closely related, although clearly distinct, enzymes are present in fish (fugu and zebra), as well as in frogs (Xenopus tropicalis). A three-dimensional model of human CLN2 was built based mainly on the homology with Pseudomonas sp. 101 sedolisin. CONCLUSION: CLN2 is very highly conserved and widely distributed among higher organisms and may play an important role in their life cycles. The model presented here indicates a very open and accessible active site that is almost completely conserved among all known CLN2 enzymes. This result is somehow surprising for a tripeptidase where the presence of a more constrained binding pocket was anticipated. This structural model should be useful in the search for the physiological substrates of these enzymes and in the design of more specific inhibitors of CLN2.'],\n",

Here, we show that several hallmarks of cellular autophagosomes can be identified in poliovirus-induced vesicles, including colocalization of LAMP1 and LC3, the human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg8p, and staining with the fluorophore monodansylcadaverine followed by fixation. Colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1 was observed early in the poliovirus replicative cycle, in cells infected with rhinoviruses 2 and 14, and in cells that express poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A, known to be sufficient to induce double-membraned vesicles. Stimulation of autophagy increased poliovirus yield, and inhibition of the autophagosomal pathway by 3-methyladenine or by RNA interference against mRNAs that encode two different proteins known to be required for autophagy decreased poliovirus yield. We propose that, for poliovirus and rhinovirus, components of the cellular machinery of autophagosome formation are subverted to promote viral replication. Although autophagy can serve in the innate immune response to microorganisms, our findings are inconsistent with a role for the induced autophagosome-like structures in clearance of poliovirus. Instead, we argue that these double-membraned structures provide membranous supports for viral RNA replication complexes, possibly enabling the nonlytic release of cytoplasmic contents, including progeny virions, from infected cells.'],\n",

    "Now we can fill up the vector-based index as users lookup documents using the text-based index. Although this approach requires two searches per user query (one on the text-based indexes and the other one on the vector-based indexes), it's simpler to implement and will be incrementatly faster as user use the system.<br/><br/>\n",

Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.',\n",

       "  Document(page_content='In vitro assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid cores, called core-like particles (CLPs), requires a polyanionic cargo. There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate single-stranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103146/'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: Tripeptidyl-peptidase I, also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of sedolisins (serine-carboxyl peptidases). In humans, defects in expression of this enzyme lead to a fatal neurodegenerative disease, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Similar enzymes have been found in the genomic sequences of several species, but neither systematic analyses of their distribution nor modeling of their structures have been previously attempted. RESULTS: We have analyzed the presence of orthologs of human CLN2 in the genomic sequences of a number of eukaryotic species. Enzymes with sequences sharing over 80% identity have been found in the genomes of macaque, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. Closely related, although clearly distinct, enzymes are present in fish (fugu and zebra), as well as in frogs (Xenopus tropicalis). A three-dimensional model of human CLN2 was built based mainly on the homology with Pseudomonas sp. 101 sedolisin. CONCLUSION: CLN2 is very highly conserved and widely distributed among higher organisms and may play an important role in their life cycles. The model presented here indicates a very open and accessible active site that is almost completely conserved among all known CLN2 enzymes. This result is somehow surprising for a tripeptidase where the presence of a more constrained binding pocket was anticipated. This structural model should be useful in the search for the physiological substrates of these enzymes and in the design of more specific inhibitors of CLN2.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC280685/'})],\n",
