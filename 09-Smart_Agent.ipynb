    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",

       "1. **Teach Children to Identify Their Needs**: Encourage children to express their needs and feelings, even if they go against the family flow. This could include allowing them to express anger, grief, loss, or sadness without trying to cheer them up immediately<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Establish Clear Boundaries and Consequences**: Let children know the rules of the house and the consequences for breaking them. For example, if a child colors on the bedsheet, tell them not to do so and state the consequence, such as a timeout or losing the crayons for the rest of the day. If the child repeats the infraction, administer the consequences and explain why<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Use Discipline to Develop Internal Boundaries**: Discipline is an external boundary designed to develop internal boundaries in children. It provides a structure of safety until the child has enough structure in their character to not need it<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Allow for Emotional and Physical Space**: Sometimes, taking time off from a person, or a project, can be a way of regaining ownership over some out-of-control aspect of your life where boundaries need to be set. This can also apply to children who have never spiritually and emotionally separated from their parents<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\n",

       " AIMessage(content='Setting boundaries for children involves several key steps and considerations:\\n\\n1. **Teach Children to Identify Their Needs**: Encourage children to express their needs and feelings, even if they go against the family flow. This could include allowing them to express anger, grief, loss, or sadness without trying to cheer them up immediately<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\\n\\n2. **Establish Clear Boundaries and Consequences**: Let children know the rules of the house and the consequences for breaking them. For example, if a child colors on the bedsheet, tell them not to do so and state the consequence, such as a timeout or losing the crayons for the rest of the day. If the child repeats the infraction, administer the consequences and explain why<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\\n\\n3. **Use Discipline to Develop Internal Boundaries**: Discipline is an external boundary designed to develop internal boundaries in children. It provides a structure of safety until the child has enough structure in their character to not need it<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\\n\\n4. **Allow for Emotional and Physical Space**: Sometimes, taking time off from a person, or a project, can be a way of regaining ownership over some out-of-control aspect of your life where boundaries need to be set. This can also apply to children who have never spiritually and emotionally separated from their parents<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-09-03T12%3A36%3A56Z&se=2030-09-04T10%3A00%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=OK69n%2FVXw0MGQ%2BPPOXDLO75l5r21vymd40w1pOOu4kk%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\\n\\n5. **Encourage Ownership**: Encourage children to take ownership and responsibility. This can be facilitated by setting limits and requiring the child to embrace the problem as their own and take care of what they have embraced<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2021-10-04&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2023-', additional_kwargs={}, example=False),\n",
